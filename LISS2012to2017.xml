        <ab>Working with "Big Data" and creating sustainable projects are current concerns in the field of Digital Humanities. Five diverse projects are targeted as cases studies to explore these issues. Projects include The Old Bailey Proceedings Online, The Perseus Digital Library Project, Boston Streets Mapping Directory, Digital Harlem, and Going to the Show. These projects are highlighted as they showcase a variety of models and techniques for promoting documentation and sustainability of big data work in the digital humanities. From these case studies a story emerges. Sustainable, interoperable projects in the digital humanities are deeply tied to acknowledging and integrating the work of digital humanists into wider, already established realms of research and scholarship. This is reflected in three unique areas can be used to evaluate the proficiency of these projects. These areas are technical documentation, citation recommendations, and bibliographies.</ab>

        <ab>Architectural records have always presented unique challenges to archivists, being much larger, both in size and volume, and having different organizational needs than most manuscript materials. Born-digital (Computer-Aided Design or CAD) architectural records are particularly complex, being one of the most difficult types of electronic records to manage. Appraisal of these records has proved challenging, because few archives possess staff with expertise in reading architectural records or the technical expertise to deal with CAD file formats. A larger problem persists, in that no single record type or format has been defined as the archivable record. Is it possible to define the archivable architectural record in a collaborative, holistic way? Institutions that collect these materials face challenges in determining those records of enduring value, arranging and describing those records, and providing long-term access to them. This paper proposes a collaborative approach in defining the archivable architectural record, using primary source interview data to explore which records are the most meaningful to archive. Once archivable records are identified, best practices and guidelines can be developed to ensure the longevity of those records.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study examined archival processing practices for sound recordings; primarily how and whether the practice of minimal processing termed "More Product Less Process" ("MPLP") can be applied to audiovisual holdings. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen professionals representing eleven significant audiovisual archives throughout the United States. Participants were asked to share their perceptions of minimal processing, to self-identify where their own processing practice falls along the minimal-maximal spectrum, to explain what factors go into their methodological choices, and to discuss the role or response of their users. Participants expressed an appreciation for the need to get collections out for use as quickly and efficiently as possible, but expressed concern over whether this was possible within a minimalistic framework. Nearly half of all respondents described their institution's approach as trending towards the maximalist end of the spectrum, while acknowledging that priorities and descriptive levels were ultimately largely collection and context dependent.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the findings of fifty interviews seeking to discover the current status of PREMIS (PREservation metadata: implementation strategies) implementation in American archives and historical societies and the factors influencing these implementation decisions. The survey was designed to address two research questions: are American archives and historical societies implementing the PREMIS standard for preservation metadata and what barriers are being discussed by staff at these repositories prior to implementation decisions. Additionally, for those repositories THAT had not implemented PREMIS, the interviews sought to discover how else, if at all, staff was addressing the preservation metadata needs of the digital objects. Findings indicate that AMERICAN ARCHIVES HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY CHOSEN NOT TO IMPLEMENT PREMIS IN ANY WAY. STUDY participants identified many barriers to implementing PREMIS for the description of digital objects. They also suggested support that would help them become better able to implement PREMIS. The interviews shed light on the barriers causing the staff at American archives the most difficulty in their efforts to create any kind of metadata for their digital objects, using any schema or standard.</ab>

        <ab>The visual representation of a cluster of similar text documents is typically accomplished with interactive information visualizations, yet some benefit can be derived even from static diagrams of the document collections. This study examines the comparative efficacy of text and diagram presentation formats for representing such collections, and attempts to determine the degree to which the format of an interface can affect users' ability to select relevant information being provided there. The hypothesis under examination holds that adults locate relevant documents more efficiently from a node-link diagram of the document set than from a textual list with the commonly used title-and-snippet format. Empirical data from a 40-person user study does not provide statistically significant support for the hypothesis; literature on similar studies helps to contextualize and explain this outcome, and directions for future study are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Borrowing from archival theory, the paper examines the application of More Product, Less Process (MPLP) on newspaper digitization projects. The paper includes an overview of the utilization of historical newspapers as research material and examines the complexities surrounding their preservation and discoverability. Analysis focuses on the strong and long-standing arguments for increased access to historic newspapers, using an exploratory, multi-method approach to examine the impact -- potential and realized -- of digitization technologies and initiatives on access to these sources. Findings reveal the diversity of approaches to description and granularity in the United States, while also praising the standardization efforts of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) as well as NDNP's leadership in facilitating access to historic newspapers. Findings demonstrate a need for increased collaboration in order to promote discoverability of digital newspaper collections created without NDNP funding, and suggest a need to de-stigmatize non-compliance with NDNP standards in independently funded projects.</ab>

        <ab>This study discusses best practices in describing architectural records in special collections repositories through encoded finding aids. It argues that metadata elements within these finding aids could serve as more effective access points if end users were more easily able to develop their own ways of highlighting relationships which exist within and across collections. Based on the information gathered from semi-structured interviews, this paper reports how other archivists developed institutional standards with which to catalog and process their architectural collections. Finally, this paper provides examples of what could be achieved in the realm of data visualization in an attempt to inspire repositories to make it easier for end users to extract the metadata that archivists and librarians spend so much time collecting.</ab>

        <ab>This master's paper will analyze the usage of a branch library collection in two different ways. First, it will collect and analyze circulation data recorded about the print monograph collection to learn more about how different sections of the library are being used as well as the circulation trends for certain types of items. Second, it will discuss how faculty members use the print monograph collection by analyzing the results of a survey given to faculty in the departments that the library serves. It is suggested that circulation statistics and faculty surveys can be used to guide collection development to focus on areas of the collection that are most used or studied by faculty, particularly as print budgets are being cut and monograph collections are shrinking..</ab>

        <ab>This paper details the process of implementing The Archivists' Toolkit (AT), an open source archival management application, at The Music Maker Relief Foundation (MMRF), a non-profit institution with a significant amount of audiovisual materials of : cultural and historical interest. An overview of MMRF's past approach to archival management, its current stage of organizational renovation and development, and the benefits of incorporating new archival practices and standards are discussed. Recommendations are made for future arrangement, description and access to MMRF's archives. The results of this project may potentially be extended to other non-traditional organizations with significant archival holdings.</ab>

        <ab>This study performs a content analysis on a series of written assignments submitted by students in an undergraduate English Composition class at a community college. Students attended four collaboratively-planned library instruction sessions during the semester. This study seeks to determine how these sessions may have affected the essay products. The study used a rubric to make a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the quality and development of student writing over the course of three writing assignments, examining the writing against the standards of the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) "Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education." Five recommendations to strengthen the collaboration with the goal of improving student writing are included.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the results of a usability study conducted on the mobile website for the UNC-Chapel Hill library. The study focused on basic information-finding tasks prioritized by the existing mobile site: locating a book, getting information about branch library hours and locations, and contacting a librarian for help. Findings indicated that the mobile version of the website was highly usable for the tasks tested, with all participants successfully completing all tasks performed on the mobile interface. However, navigating to the mobile interface itself proved difficult, as there is no automatic redirect from the full site to the mobile site for users of mobile devices. When not provided with the pre-loaded mobile site as a starting point for a task, most participants used the full site, where they encountered problems with overall usability and site functionality.</ab>

        <ab>A growing trend in collection development among academic libraries is demand driven acquisition (DDA) of e-books, which involves loading large batches of records that meet a library's bibliographic profile into the online catalog. Materials can typically be accessed by patrons as a short-term loan for two or three times before purchase of the title is automatically triggered. This study examined the costs of DDA for a large academic library that went directly to purchase, bypassing the lending process. Pricing information was obtained for each title and circulation information was obtained from the e-book vendor. These data were also collected for e-books that were acquired through approval plan selection. This information was used to generate cost per use data. These numbers were compared to determine whether DDA resulted in a lower cost per use than approval plan selection.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a latent content analysis of the deeds of gift currently used by collecting repositories in the United States. The study was conducted to determine the presence of a range of concepts related to digital materials and born-digital objects in a collecting repository's deed of gift. Nearly one-third of 80 deeds of gift discuss digital materials, yet only five repositories currently address born-digital objects. Access to digital materials and digital preservation activities are the concepts most likely to be addressed in deeds of gift, while the specification of the repository as holder of the official research digital copy, the creation of technical metadata, and method of capturing born-digital objects are among the concepts least likely to be discussed. Data suggest longer deeds of gift are more likely to address concepts related to digital materials and born-digital objects.</ab>

The interviews were designed to explore which digital forensic tools are in use, how they are implemented within a digital forensics workflow, and what further challenges and opportunities such use may present. Findings indicate that among interview participants these tools are beneficial in the capture and preservation of born-digital content, particularly with digital media such as external hard drives, and optical or floppy disks. However, interviews reveal that metadata generated from the use of such tools is not easily translated into the arrangement, description, and provision of access to born-digital content.</ab>

        <ab>The policies developed by the libraries of the Consolidated University of North Carolina (The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; The North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering of the University of North Carolina, Raleigh; and The Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, Greensboro) over the period from 1951 to 1958 demonstrate the difficulties African-Americans faced when pursuing scholarly research, as well as the broader challenges of integrating higher education institutions. Although all three schools shared an overarching administration, each one handled African-American library patrons differently. This inconsistency became a source of contention during the early 1950s, as the University system attempted to maintain "separate but equal" facilities for African-Americans, in an effort to put off integration. This preliminary report outlines and analyzes these policies, places them in the context of African-American scholarship and higher education during the time period, and suggests avenues for further research.</ab>

        <ab>Scaling up to handle big data can be challenging for the Digital Humanities given the often diverse and unpredictable nature of such data. This project proposes a system for automatically harvesting North Carolina city directories by developing a historically-minded parser. City directories vary significantly in format and structure, making the use of a one-size-fits-all approach impossible. Building a smarter parser requires that historical variances be taken into account from the outset. Such an understanding may come from an analysis of directory attributes, including the presence of a header or the connotation of a resident's racial classification. When taken together, these attributes reveal patterns across directory publishers, city locations, and publication years that form the basis of parameters for adjusting the parser to improve overall automatic data extraction. This project demonstrates how applying historical thinking to computational solutions contributes to more effective tools for handling big humanities data.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study examined the information-seeking and information-use behaviors of individuals who work with oral histories. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with scholars and archivists. The study identified a range of interrelated tasks that these users engage in, including: question formulation, discovery of collections, information-seeking within collections, working with tapes, working with transcripts, use of other primary source materials in conjunction with oral histories, the creation of original oral histories, note-taking, and analysis. Finally, this paper discusses the implications of these user behaviors for oral history repositories.</ab>

        <ab>Both privacy policies and end-user licensing agreements (EULAs) are ubiquitous in today's computing environment. Users are frequently prompted to agree to privacy policies and EULAs, and often do so without even looking at them. This is in seemingly direct contradiction to the documented concern consumers feel regarding the capture, storage and handling of their personal information by websites and mobile applications. This study explores why users may choose to disregard the single document that describes the level of privacy they can expect from websites and software companies. In particular, the interface, by which these policies are communicated to the user, is addressed, as previous research has noted its many deficiencies. The survey results indicate that users have a desire for increased control over their own personal information and that barriers, such as long blocks of legal text, should be addressed in order to increase policy notice readership on the web.</ab>

This paper examines the link between the widespread use of online genealogy databases and the drop in visitorship to public record repositories through qualitative feedback from interviews with professional genealogists and state archive employees. This study also discusses the relationship between archivists and genealogists and offers suggestions as to how archivists can better serve genealogists and recoup lost visitation numbers through enhancing archival websites and digital collections.</ab>

        <ab>Numerous case studies describing individual community college libraries' instruction programs have been published, but there have been few attempts to identify common characteristics of these programs. This study describes the results of a survey in which documentation from the instruction programs of 15 North Carolina community college libraries was analyzed against program design guidelines from the ACRL's "Guidelines for Instruction Programs in Academic Libraries" document. The study found no correlation between variables describing the parent institutions of these libraries and the degree to which the libraries' instructional programming appeared to adhere to the ACRL guidelines; however, given the educational importance of community colleges to a very large and diverse student body with a variety of information needs, further research in this area is recommended. This study suggests that such research should avoid a methodology in which internal documentation is chosen to represent instruction programs.</ab>

        <ab>All public libraries in North Carolina currently provide digital library resources to their patrons through NC LIVE, a statewide consortium that offers eBooks, audiobooks, journal articles, and other electronic resources. Librarians remain the crucial link between resources and public users, but many librarians experience difficulty using NC LIVE. Through the use of a survey and semi-structured interviews, this study assesses current usage of and training needs for NC LIVE resources by North Carolina Public librarians and staff. Results indicate a wide spectrum of usage rates and training needs on digital resources by librarians. A discussion of the results, including recommendations for creating training materials, is included in this paper.</ab>

        <ab>With the growth of the digital humanities and historical GIS technologies, scholars have begun to build national and urban databases of census and other records in order to trace the changes in boundaries over time and thus simplify the study of historical change. Because a project to digitize U.S. census enumeration district maps would require time, funding, and staff that most institutions do not have, the most sensible way to create such a database is through crowdsourcing. Other crowdsourced projects, both geographical and non-geographical, have succeeded owing to their creative design and competitive focus as well as the usability of the tools they provide to their volunteer users. Upon review of other crowdsourced mapping projects, recommendations are given for the creation of a GIS database for U.S. census enumeration district maps.</ab>

        <ab>This paper argues that increased use of Informal Language in an organization's Tweets will increase their number of Followers on Twitter. An unobtrusive content analysis was conducted on approximately 12,000 Tweets authored by 18 academic institutions, all members of the iSchools organization, in order to extract instances of Informal Language. The findings suggest that Informal Language is an effective means of communication in the context of Twitter, and imply more broadly that conforming to the conventions established by any social media platform is an effective means of increasing presence and influence in a given medium.</ab>

Four follow-up questions asked participants to describe how they originally intended to use their devices, how behavior has changed as they've started using them, if or when they multi-task and to summarize what each device is used for.</ab>

        <ab>The proposed Stage II Meaningful Use (MU) objectives, would require healthcare organizations to offer patients the ability to access their health related information through a web-based portal. However, MU criteria is just one of the underlying reasons patient portals will become an essential component of thriving healthcare organizations. As the Internet technology permanently altered the way in which we shop, bank, communicate and distribute information, these capabilities have also entered healthcare arena with the promise of improving patient-provider communications and healthcare outcomes. This paper addresses the role of patient portals in meeting the MU objectives, evaluates interest and factors influencing healthcare consumers' utilization of portals, and identifies barriers to adoption of portal technologies by healthcare organizations.</ab>

        <ab>HIVE, an automated metadata generation application in continuing development by the Metadata Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center based in Durham, North Carolina, has been tested in studies that mainly focus on the accuracy of a complete set of headings assigned by human indexers for a particular item. Using a SKOS implementation of the MeSH vocabulary, the current study takes a more system-internal view-an attempt to better understand, through copious logging information in iterative and in-process tuning, the internals of HIVE, and from thence to make methodological recommendations for improvements to the training process. Findings suggest that certain easy-to-implement refinements of this process can result in better performance overall, and that specific features of particular SKOS vocabularies should be considered when rating performance. Suggestions are offered for possible refinements to the core (KEA++) code used in HIVE.</ab>

The survey was conducted to determine the availability, variety, and content present online among the presidential websites. All of the libraries provided some educational resources from lesson plans, bibliographic, biographic, primary source, curriculum guides, and other resources. The most beneficial to teachers are the resources like lesson plans and the guides to understanding the curriculum and the primary sources in regards to the collection. None of the libraries examined provided all of these valuable resources to the educator but rather a combination of some of the resources.</ab>

The interdisciplinary nature of the Common Core, its emphasis on non-fiction texts, and the local school district's focus on speaking and listening skills were reflected. After articulating essential questions and the students' desired enduring understandings, I identified gaps in the instructional practices and devised new academic strategies and assessment tools to strengthen the lessons. Other steps included gathering resources available through the school media center. I assembled the final product as four digital portfolios, plus two reference binders. This paper provides on overview of the new standards, discusses local educational priorities, gives an overview of the digital resource and offers reflections on the collaborative process.</ab>

        <ab>The North Carolina AHEC Digital Library (ADL) is an electronic network of resources for in-state health care providers to easily access select medical and pharmaceutical information. A quick retrieval of subscription-specific content is available through a site search tool on the ADL website. A cursory review of transaction logs for website searching revealed a large number of failed patron search attempts, which prompted a study to learn how the site search tool is being used and what the ADL can do to improve search effectiveness. A comparison between physician and nurse search behavior from 2010 will be performed to see which factors yield successful and unsuccessful results, the average number of queries per subject session, and which resource links are used by patrons. The study outcome will guide menu changes to the ADL website to improve the site search experience for patrons.</ab>

        <ab>Although much has been learned about good web design principles since academic library websites became commonplace, the changing landscape of the web makes it is necessary to periodically test the usability of library websites to assess how effectively they provide services and information to users. Moreover, with users accessing library services remotely via the web more than ever before, the importance of library websites has increased proportionally. This is especially true for music library websites, as users increasingly access scores and recordings through music libraries' websites. This paper describes a task-based usability test designed to gather both quantitative and qualitative data about a university music library website. The study was successful in identifying areas where the website could be improved and generating recommendations to make these changes.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to offer some insight into changes that are occurring in the expectations and behaviors of today's Web searcher, and to provide evidence on whether public libraries are addressing these needs in the design of their Web sites. The paper investigates current trends in public library OPAC interfaces, particularly the prevalence of the use of federated searching. This paper also provides an evaluation of interface usability of public library Web sites, identifies flaws in design, and suggests ways in which libraries can improve their online search services for today's information seekers.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores whether the combination of a structured wiki and a tagging vocabulary create a more effective digital collaborative space than email communication, for both current collaboration needs and the retrieval of past collaboration information. To test this, I added a predefined tagging vocabulary and collaboration nodes to the North Carolina Area Health Education Centers' underused wiki. The methods involved tracking the NC AHEC team's email and wiki communication for two months after implementation of the redesigned wiki and comparing this data to retroactively collected use of wiki and email for ten months prior to implementation. The study also included surveys before and after the study, addressing subjects' attitudes towards wikis and tagging. The subjects' overall use of both communication tools decreased, but due to several potential factors, the cause could not be determined. The study results were inconclusive.</ab>

        <ab>Through historical research and observations, the intention of this project is to explore the nature of the role of the book cover in today's market. Further research into the industry will help librarians to make informed predictions about the future of book cover design with the rise of e-readers, which greatly diminish a reader's ability to make selections based on the cover alone. As the technology of reading changes, designers will have to adapt, changing their cover art to gain more attention when covers are only displayed as small, even black and white, icons. By examining this dynamic industry, insights will be gained for designers, readers, and librarians, who are increasingly making collection development decisions for e-books. Books have historically had aesthetic value in their physical form, but as this form changes, perception of what a book is also changes, particularly for books that may exist only in electronic forms.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines an asynchronous, form-based model of service for Readers' Advisory within a public library setting. Literature addresses some limitations of the traditional model of Readers' Advisory service, including patron reluctance to approach librarians and time constraints for librarians handling multiple tasks and requests. One potential solution to overcoming these limitations is providing an asynchronous, form- based model of Reader's Advisory service. This study introduces a form-based model as an experimental service in a pilot-study with the Chapel Hill (NC) Public Library. To assess the service model, data was collected through survey responses from study participants and interview responses from participant-librarians. Results demonstrate that patrons and library professionals benefit from the provision of a form-based model of Readers' Advisory service. Suggestions for further research considering the form-based service model, and the professional development of Readers' Advisory skills for public librarians are included.</ab>

        <ab>This paper begins with a concept: establishing a shared datasets initiative at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science (SILS). The initiative under proposal would attempt to introduce a collection of digital datasets, as a shared learning object, into courses across the school's curriculum to augment learning on digital data topics. The program would have four primary components: program oversight, infrastructure, resources, and services. This feasibility study was designed to ascertain how and whether a shared datasets initiative should be designed for the school. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with SILS faculty and students; in addition, several common reading program administrators and data experts were interviewed. Based on these data, specific recommendations are made for the implementation of a shared datasets initiative at SILS. These recommendations address decisions to be made about technology infrastructure, dataset selection, and the importance of visible success.</ab>

        <ab>The Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is one of the premier archival repositories for primary documents about the American South. Its founder, J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton, a professor of history at the university, is remembered for his rambles across the South from the 1920s through 1940s, in search of historical documents. Too often, Hamilton's work is thought of as a solitary effort. In reality, the creation of the collection could not have been accomplished without support. This paper considers Hamilton and the Southern Historical Collection from the perspectives of his own family history and education; the supportive environment found at UNC; and the interactions Hamilton had with donors, the press, historians, and archivists. All of these elements fostered the growth of the Southern Historical Collection and, when seen together, they provide a more complex view of the both the founder and the collection.</ab>

        <ab>This research examines fourteen examples of juvenile and young adult fiction novels that include characters with disabilities. The study aims to analyze seven works of literature written between the years 1980-1990, and seven works of literature written between the years 2000-2010 in order to determine if the portrayals of characters with disabilities have seen improvement. Improvement in this sense would mean that the characters with disabilities were portrayed in a positive light, with a realistic depiction, and including a great sense of character development throughout the novel in which they are featured. Through this study, it is evident that there is marked improvement in the portrayals of characters with disabilities, yet further representation in the amount of novels that are available for young audiences is still a work in progress.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this master's project is to assess the information needs of a developing hedge fund and make recommendations in the design and implementation of information systems that can support the organization's activities. While the names of the fund, its employees, and manager are fictional, the assessment and recommendations delivered in this paper are based on the needs of an existing startup, and intended to support the ongoing development of its infrastructure. This project will delineate the functional requirements of the proposed systems in consideration of the needs of the organization's primary stakeholders, describe existing systems, and establish a process for the organization to develop new or adapt existing systems.</ab>

        <ab>Research was conducted to develop a clear picture of user preference at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by having representative users answer questions about their use of the library in a questionnaire and following-up with a usability test. The usability testing involved two main goals: first, participants compared two search pages, one with tabs similar to the current library homepage and one without that is similar to a Google interface. This first goal also tested the library's new combined search known as Articles + Catalog. The second portion of the tests involved having the participants respond to a proposed library homepage in order to gather feedback for a redesign project. The resulting data showed users preferred the tabbed widget, but overall participants were not averse to the use of the simple widget on the proposed library homepage since the information they found most important was still available.</ab>

        <ab>This study seeks to examine the body sizes of the main characters in Caldecott award winning picture books from 1938 until 2013. 93 characters were examined in order to see whether or not the bodies depicted were as unrealistic as those presented in other popular media. The results found that there were a disproportionate number of underweight characters, though, when analyzed over time, that number is decreasing.</ab>

        <ab>Due to the rapidly burgeoning volume of born-digital records, it behooves archives to determine how they can best bridge the gap between handling analog and handling born-digital records. In addition to analyzing existing case studies' of repositories that already accession and process electronic records, the study presented in this paper used both a survey instrument and semi-structured interviews with archivists to investigate whether and how manuscript repositories are handling born-digital materials. The intent of this study has been to pinpoint some of the problems that plague manuscript repositories in particular and to identify some practical steps that have already been taken at similar repositories and should be replicated and suggest courses for further study and action. The problems of handling born-digital materials, especially when it comes to providing access, are not unique, and the profession would be well served by finding a space for collaboration to solve these thorny issues.</ab>

        <ab>The following study is a qualitative analysis of the content of 30 academic library privacy policies. These policies were analyzed to identify how libraries approach patron privacy through published policies. The key findings of the study include that there is a strong focus on legislation and regulatory compliance among academic libraries. Notably, there was a smaller focus on information regarding how personal records may be released and to whom they were released. Among libraries studied, there was little reference to ALA practices, policy making ethics or other guidelines. Finally, there was little emphasis on information regarding patron consent and release of information. With the advent of newer technologies and a greater population of individuals able to use and understand them, libraries must implement a variety of measures to protect patrons private records and information.</ab>

        <ab>This content analysis study assesses the depiction of multicultural characters in a sample of 22 children's transitional and middle-grade mystery books published after 1996. Characters of color were evaluated for the prominence of their role in the story and the presence or absence of cultural context and stereotypes among main characters. Most characters were classified as narrators or as non-narrator main characters, and over half of these were written with good cultural context. The one stereotype that appears to persist in this genre is that of impoverished or tragedy-stricken African-American characters; however, an underlying problem is the difficulty of finding enough Asian-Americans, Latino/as, and Native Americans in this genre to conclusively determine whether they, too, are portrayed stereotypically.</ab>

        <ab>As consumers search for an increasing amount of health information online, it is important for the information that they find to not only be accurate, but written in an appropriate and accessible level of readability. Eight consumer health information websites were selected and a portion of text from each on the topic of macular degeneration, an eye disease that affects many older Americans and can result in the loss of central vision, was evaluated. The readability of the text was calculated using two tests: the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index and the Flesch Reading Ease test. These calculations confirmed expectations that online consumer health information for macular degeneration is incomprehensible for a sizeable segment of the American population. According to the results, this information is written on average at a reading level of nearly the eleventh grade.</ab>

        <ab>This study details the latent content analysis of seven young adult novels describing either dystopian or post-apocalyptic environments that centered on one strong female character. The focus of the analysis centered on each of the main characters as the strength of each character to determine the sources of their strength, to determine whether these sources were character traits or outside environmental sources and to define what roles that the other characters in the book play in the development of their strength. Ten different sources were isolated and it was determined that there are a mixture of both character traits and outside influences, as well as the influence of abstract ideals. It was determined that the influence of the relationships that each of the heroines experience served either as a motivation of their actions or support to endure their difficulties.</ab>

        <ab>Classics, the study of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, is a field that thrives on the old and the long past. Classicists may often be stereotyped by library science scholars as being resistant to technology. As academic libraries are turning to digital materials at an increasing rate, it is likely that it will soon become necessary for classicists to do more research online. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important for academic librarians to consider the current information seeking behavior of classicists, specifically how they use print and electronic resources for teaching and research. This knowledge will help librarians to design more effective instruction, collection development, and support for this group. This study will examine the information seeking behavior of the faculty and graduate students in the Classics Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and suggest ways of optimizing the collecting of print and electronic resources for classicists.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the results to supplement previous work to include testing 7" display devices (mini tablet) and compare its performance to tablet and phone directly (and to desktop indirectly via the previous results). The study was only concerned with the within documentation navigation using scrolling interaction to evaluate how these methods affect task efficiency on seven inch display (iPad mini). Overall, the quantitative data was reflected by task execution time and qualitative data was analyzed using task load and usability data measures. Findings indicated that most users would likely spend more time in searching task on mobile devices they carry around (phone), which echoed the conclusion by Laura Marcial's previous research. In terms of seven inch tablet, it performed better than phone and more or less equally to the tablet.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to examine a selection of recent young adult dystopian novels and determine how they help teen readers cope with both the anxieties of the 21st century world and adolescent development. Five novels were read and underwent a two-part analysis. The first part compared the texts to analogous events in the real world and discussed the authors' inspirations for their stories. The second was to search the texts for examples of adolescent development in their protagonists. The results showed that all five novels showed elements that are parallel to current issues in the world and that many aspects of adolescent development are present and even essential to the plots and structure of young adult dystopian fiction. It was then concluded that fiction can help readers both cope with personal development and world issues.</ab>

        <ab>Library research and instruction departments are increasingly focused on improving and expanding their online subject guides. This case study examines analytic data from one year of subject guide use at a Research-I institution. A sample of over 110 total subject guides was analyzed. The subject guides were examined for indicators of information load, as measured by number of total resources on the multi-tab subject guides and number of pages in each subject guide. Resources in individual guides ranged in number from under ten to several thousand. The analytic data on the guides provides information on how students and other university affiliates used the guides, including time spent in each guide and page views. By correlating the number of resources and pages with the analytic data, preliminary conclusions about best practices for information load in subject guides were drawn, such as minimizing the number of pages in a guide.</ab>

        <ab>Libraries serve an increasing number of remote users. Within academic and special libraries, remote users comprise geographically dispersed users, including users in low- and middle-income countries. The libraries that serve users in low- and middle-income countries may insufficiently understand the needs of and barriers to library use among remote users in those areas. This paper reports the results of a study done to examine the extent of and barriers to use of library services among international staff at an international non-profit. The study first sought to determine the differences in usage levels of library resources among international staff and U.S.-based staff and then to identify the information needs and barriers to use of library resources and services among international staff. The results presented here indicate that lack of library and bibliographic instruction contribute to lower usage levels and that infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries may further inhibit library use.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined depictions of betrayal in young adult fiction across the genres of realistic fiction, science fiction, and fantasy. Similarities and differences were analyzed to unearth conventions or parallels that appear in the texts. Relevant Psychology literature was consulted to determine whether the reactions, emotions, and experiences that characters encounter throughout these novels accurately reflected the observed behavior of young adults in the research. A literary sample of twelve novels was examined using a set of researcher-created guidelines. Data analysis utilized emergent coding based on the texts, and a priori coding based on the research. Results indicated that while content differs between genres, the depictions of betrayal, relationships, and emotions were consistent. Similarly, the sample texts displayed characteristics and themes that were accurate appropriate in accordance with relevant psychology literature. Therefore, it is highly likely that these texts would be useful to adolescent readers struggling with betrayal.</ab>

        <ab>Over two million soldiers deployed in 2011. Each had a family affected by the deployment, but with only 2% of American families including a military member, society is becoming indifferent to service persons and their loved ones at home. For spouses and significant others, military support includes online forums, social networks and organizations. These supports are limited and recommended reading lists are largely limited to nonfiction -- how-to guides and memoirs of soldiers, not their spouses. Dealing with deployment, long separations, frequent relocation and the uncertainty of a spouse's safety poses a discrete set of emotional issues faced by these community members. Thus, this group is well suited to being provided informal bibliotherapy. Bibliotherapy focuses on the power of books, both fiction and nonfiction, to offer catharsis and insight to readers. This bibliography will help public libraries and military spouses to identify literature for relief of emotional stress surrounding military life.</ab>

        <ab>While libraries employ marketing in various forms, the challenge is keeping up with the rapidly changing discourse concerning marketing that exists outside of the library and information science (LIS) field. This research examines an innovative approach to marketing undertaken by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center Library. The case study specifically investigates the implementation of narrative marketing and appreciative inquiry within the framework of previously established best practices for library marketing. This research demonstrates how implementing narrative marketing enables libraries to conduct, evidence based librarianship, and documents the entire process used by the North Carolina Biotech Library to create a narrative marketing plan, from its initial development to its implementation. This process included an internal assessment of the library's service offerings, as well as a survey of the library's users. The data gathered enabled the library staff to justify which services to emphasize in the library's narrative campaign.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on a usability test (n=10) that evaluated the web interface of the Dryad repository of biological data. Participants, mostly biologists, were asked to find information about the database, find and download data, and upload data. These three workflows were tested with a card sorting procedure and a think-aloud protocol. The results suggest that biologists interact with online database systems much like non-biologists; color, placement, and size of buttons and text were important determiners of recognition and acknowledgement. However, while most web users prefer browsing to seek information on new websites, participants in this study preferred searching. Most participants did not arrive at the website at the homepage, and thus reported a lack of information about Dryad at their initial entry point. Recommendations for enhancing Dryad specifically and web database interfaces in general are included.</ab>

        <ab>Virtual Reference has been provided in libraries since the early 1900s. It started with the E-mail Reference Service, and in the mid-1990s it continued with Chat Reference Service. However, the Chat Reference Service and the E-mail Reference Service present special characteristics that influence the questions users ask through them. The present study analyses, categorizes, compares and highlights the differences and similarities of the questions received through these 2 virtual reference services in Walter Royal Davis Library, the main academic library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Despite the differences, Policy and Procedural questions are the most common ones in both services, which are distinct from the Reference Transactions traditionally expected. The results of the study will contribute to the LIS literature regarding virtual reference services. Also, they will be especially helpful to the researcher's home institution in its implementation of the Chat Reference Service.</ab>

        <ab>With the idea of "More Product Less Process" (MPLP) introduced by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner there has been a shift to light processing in various types of archival institutions and many collections. Since 2005 the literature discussing this idea has focused on differing opinions of archivists and whether they use MPLP. Many institutions have quoted and clearly expressed their acceptance of MPLP within their processing procedures. However, there is a clear line between organizations that have accepted and denied the use of the idea. This study examines whether MPLP is a recent change within the last decade or an ideal part of processing within archival institutions for several years.</ab>

        <ab>This study is an examination of one hundred and ten early printed books with imprint dates prior to 1700 at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. These books currently lack significant use, in part due to their status as an at least partially hidden collection. The first portion of this paper examines how the Special Collections Research Center at NCSU could begin to build an outreach program to encourage greater use of these items, and touches on themes such as rare books in mathematics and the sciences, rare books and special collections at land-grant universities, and ways in which outreach in special collections is changing. The second half is made up of a descriptive catalogue of the early printed books to aid NCSU staff, researchers, and students in using the early printed books at N.C. State.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the findings of a study designed to assess the use of Quick Response (QR) Codes in visual materials exhibits in library, archive, and museum visual materials exhibits. Seven institutions were recruited to fill out a survey to assess the perceived ease or difficulty of implementation of QR Codes, usefulness of the technology, and likelihood of using this or other mobile technology in future exhibits. A lack of adequate survey responses prevented the author from presenting substantive statistical conclusions; however, the author speculates about a perceived decline in use of QR Codes in libraries, archives, and museums, as well as potential future research into mobile technologies in visual materials exhibits.</ab>

        <ab>Community analysis techniques have been proposed as ways that public libraries can assess the information needs of their communities. Despite the need for community assessment or analysis, very little research has been done to compare the various techniques used by public libraries for gathering information about the service population. Using the libraries participating in the Building Common Ground initiative, this study attempted to see if there is a correlation between techniques used and the performance of subsequent programming. While failing to meet standards of statistical significance, the quantitative and qualitative data gathered through the study suggests that certain techniques, as well as the use of several techniques together, are associated with increased program performance.</ab>

        <ab>A qualitative phenomenological study investigated the challenges faced by African American women pursuing upper management positions in the field of Information Technology. The study detailed the subjects' experiences of achieving their goals of upper management, including their reflections and sentiments on pursuing their goals. The research findings indicated a number of factors contributed to the advancement of the subjects, all African American women, as they moved into upper management. No distinct underlying factor guaranteed success; instead, the women used a number of elements that enabled them to advance. These factors included mentoring, education, and individual personality traits. The study also found a number of challenges that affected the subjects' progress into management, such as performance weariness, keeping their thoughts arid ideas under restraint, and remaining compliant; nevertheless, the subjects reported they found ways to advance regardless of hostile workplace circumstances.</ab>

        <ab>With the increasing focus on data sharing in the sciences and information organization in networked information-spaces, metadata has become a prominent area of research and activity. Scholars in library and information science and science studies have distinct approaches to describing and understanding metadata. This thesis reviews the accounts of metadata given by these two fields and then takes preliminary steps toward a unified analytic framework for research, based in Peircean semiotics as it has been developed within semiotic anthropology.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to explore the proactive use of basic courtesies in public library service as a potential positive influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Four small- to medium-sized public libraries in North Carolina and Virginia were surveyed before and after implementing a program to emphasize three basic customer service courtesies: greeting customers, acknowledging customers immediately upon their arrival at the point of service, and closing every transaction with a valediction or expression of thanks. Three of the four participating libraries showed improved scores in staff and service quality and evidence of increased customer loyalty after successfully implementing the basic courtesy program. The remaining library received lower scores for satisfaction and loyalty after showing a decrease in performance of basic courtesies. These small and easy-to-implement courtesies seem to positively affect customer perceptions of library service.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the results of a usability test involving two current popular cloud file storage systems: Google Drive and Dropbox. The study focused on three basic tasks performed by users in their daily usage: sharing one document to another user, sharing several documents to another user, and syncing documents from local storage to cloud storage. Findings indicate that the interface of both Google Drive and Dropbox were highly usable for users to complete sharing one document to another user and syncing one document from local storage to cloud storage. However, there were different results for sharing several documents to another user: Google Drive proved to be highly usable, but users reported encountering problems using Dropbox. Based on these findings, I propose several suggestions for future research in the area of user interface design for cloud-based file storage systems.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a usability test of novice and expert users of archival finding aids. The test was conducted to determine whether the use of definitional phrasing, phrases used to explain and differentiate vague terms, in place of standard element titles would improve the navigability of archival finding aids by novice users. Many studies have indicated that users, particularly novices, do not understand the terms used in archives and their finding aids to describe their materials. This is a serious issue for usability. This study proposed that definitional phrasing in place of standard element titles would improve the navigability of archival finding aids for novice users. The study did not find any demonstrable differences in navigation between the two versions of the finding aid, but recommends that further study be conducted to better understand both how users navigate finding aids and how improvements can be made to reflect these findings.</ab>

        <ab>When entering information into a library catalog, a cataloger holds a lot of power as to the representation of certain groups within the library's online catalog. Catalogers have a responsibility to present information fairly and inclusively. Much like a librarian must avoid bias when selecting books for purchase, the cataloger must be careful to be inclusive in choosing subject headings and be aware of inherent biases that may prevent a patron from accessing the resources needed. Using qualitative analysis, this paper examines the representation of the Lumbee Indian Tribe of North Carolina within academic library catalogs of North Carolina institutions.</ab>

        <ab>Access control is a fundamental safeguard for protecting corporate information contained in computer files (herein documents). In the de facto industry standard implementation, the most granular access control specification available is to define the entry on the entire document object. Given the proliferation of data privacy regulations mandating varying degrees of information security controls and practices, one must consider to what extent inefficiency arises due to the withholding from a collaborative workflow relevant information entwined with discrete sensitive information of which not all members of the workflow are authorized to access. Contemporary research in the field proposes a digital metamorphosis of the analogue document redaction paradigm. This research explores the aforementioned inefficiency phenomenon as well as purported utility of redaction through examination of survey data from faculty and staff at a public University.</ab>

        <ab>This paper discusses using a hierarchical multi-faceted search interface for simple comment analysis utilizing the Interactive Comments in Schema (ICIS) tool. ICIS was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) School of Information and Library Science (SILS) for viewing, exploring and sharing feedback comments from some UNC Libraries. It integrates a hierarchical faceted schema, search function and faceted filters for manipulating the retrieved dataset. A research study was designed to evaluate ICIS's usability in exploring the comments, answering questions about the library services and assess if a faceted search interface is adequate for simple comment analysis. The study also compared the tool to a baseline search interface to evaluate the effects of its design over a simple search system. The findings show that all participants preferred ICIS and liked its flexibility of options in finding and viewing information. Overall performance was slightly better using ICIS.</ab>

        <ab>Geolocation services in mobile devices provide the opportunity for software developers to write apps that personalize information based on the user's location. By utilizing GPS, cellular tower location, and information about nearby wireless networks, mobile apps can determine the device's location and use this information for a variety of purposes. Web-based services such as Google Places provide an easy way to find information about establishments, including their locations, user reviews, price range, and more, and by searching with an app like Google Maps for iPhone, users can find which establishments are near their current location. While there are many iPhone apps intended for finding nearby restaurants and other establishments, there are not many that focus strongly on the open hours of the restaurants. "What's Open?" is an iPhone app designed to help people find nearby restaurants, based on their open hours, and to view detailed information about them.</ab>

        <ab>Despite their increasing popularity, adult graphic novels remain a highly misunderstood resource. This study was intended to determine whether placing graphic novels in certain locations would impact their circulation. The underlying assumption was that exposure to graphic novels would lead to a greater amount of circulations as adults unfamiliar with graphic novels would be more willing to pick them up when viewed more easily. Four academic libraries and six public libraries were asked to provide yearly and total circulation numbers of 38 bestselling adult graphic novels. All academic libraries and five public libraries responded. It was found that adult graphic novels that were given their own section circulated more frequently both yearly and for all time than those interfiled with child or young adult graphic novels or non graphic resources. Graphic novels that were not placed in a prominent location were also checked out more frequently for all time than those that were located in a prominent location.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a trial in which three undergraduate library instruction sessions were conducted using the Nearpod application, on a class set of iPads, within a SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) classroom. Based on questionnaire results, iPads, and tablet technologies generally, represent strong potential as replacements for desktop computers for use in undergraduate library instruction sessions. While presenting a few impermanent technical disadvantages, the iPad and Nearpod tools demonstrated support for active and collaborative learning approaches including: instant polling, the ability to share content, and the ability to navigate the library web page and databases. The SCALE-UP classroom has already made notable contributions in promoting undergraduate learning, and its advantages were found to be extensible to library instruction. The pedagogical approach which the space is designed to reinforce, collaborative learning segments interspersed with lecture components, seemed to promote student engagement in library instruction sessions.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines copyright knowledge among school librarians in the U.S. and the factors that contribute to their knowledge and comfort with copyright in K-12 school settings. A review of the literature reveals that school librarians are seen to have a role in complying with and teaching copyright law in schools; however, little research has been done on knowledge of copyright among school librarians. This study used a web-based survey to gather data from school librarians; 245 survey responses were usable. Results indicate that fewer than half of respondents were comfortable with their knowledge of copyright law. In addition, the relationship between self-led research and copyright knowledge was found to be statistically significant. This study may be of interest to school librarians, K-12 administrators, educators of librarians, and those assessing MLS curriculum.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes interviews with twenty-three archivists across the United States who currently maintain a Facebook Page for their respective institutions. The interviews were conducted to determine why these institutions have chosen to utilize Facebook and social media more broadly, what guidelines could be drawn for future archival participation on Facebook, and if Facebook-based outreach was effective. Based on the interviews as well as analytical data, most of the institutions included in this study have had success using Facebook as an outreach tool. They used Facebook in order to conform with expectations, raise the public profile of their institution, and share collections. The interviews also reveal four guidelines that could help archivists have further success on Facebook: highlight visual items; work collaboratively with other institutions to take advantage of Facebook's sharing tools; profile items with intrinsic value; and establish a narrow identity that focuses on one or two specific subjects.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the perceived function of a reference desk and actual usage by patrons. Interviews were conducted with employees of the Undergraduate Library at UNC-Chapel Hill to determine their perceptions of the primary intended function of the reference desk. The majority of interviewees said research-related services were the primary intended function of the desk. The reference desk was relabeled as the "Research Desk" for the Fall 2012 semester to test whether signage increased the percentage of research questions. Reference statistics were then compared to those from the Fall 2011 semester. The percentage of questions asked that were research questions dropped from Fall 2011 to Fall 2012. Though the desk is busy, research questions are the smallest percentage of questions asked at the reference desk, differing from librarian perceptions of its primary intended function. Results show that signage alone does not increase percentage of research questions asked at the desk.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a content analysis of YALSA's Top Ten Quick Picks for Reluctant Readers and Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Young Adults for the years 2007-2013. The study examines the lists for racial and ethnic groups represented by protagonists, authors, and illustrators of the titles selected for the aforementioned lists. Reluctant Readers and poor reading scores are two issues, often related, that teachers and librarians face each day. Being able to provide quality resources and authentic experience for all students, especially those of color, is critical in combatting reluctance to read and poor reading scores. The study evaluated the YALSA lists as they are a reputable, readily-available, resource for librarians and teachers to provide reader's advisory suggestions and make collection development decisions. Ultimately, the lists were found to provide an overwhelming presence of white protagonists, authors, and illustrations and be seriously lacking in representation of communities of color. From these results, it is recommended that librarian and teachers consult other resources when making reader's advisory suggestions or collection development decisions. It is also recommended that librarians advocate for their students and inform or educate the YALSA committee members that are responsible for creating such lists.</ab>

        <ab>The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) proposes a four-tier hierarchy to describe relationships between works and their derivations. Most scholarship on FRBR and musical works has concentrated on classical music within the Western canon, and little attention has been paid to other genres of music. This study takes a bipartite content sample of both classical and non-classical musical works, investigating the issues with both using the FRBR framework. Results indicate there is a blurring of the roles within popular music that can call into question the boundaries of "work" and "expression." The examination of the pieces within the classical canon revealed many FRBR-specific relationships, but also the existence of relationships with no FRBR equivalent, and the examination of non-classical works revealed even more relationships that were either ambiguous or non-existent in the FRBR framework. The study concludes that there may be significant problems trying to tackle non-classical musical works and their mutations with a strict hierarchical model such as FRBR.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is an investigation of the impact that varieties of natural language questions have on information retrieval. Ten questions were chosen and ten paraphrases of each were input into Google and Bing. The results indicated that the templates do not have a significant impact on the performance of these search engines. Instead, the results showed that questions about culturally salient information is more likely to yield an effective query, regardless of how it is phrased. Queries about other kinds of information do not perform as well because the indexing of web pages does not appear to favor more obscure topics.</ab>

        <ab>Art history publications are heavily reliant on images to illustrate their arguments, but a restrictive rights culture combined with the shrinking budgets of publishers has meant that it can be difficult to find and use the necessary images. By contrast, online cultures use images to freely express themselves in an open generative contrast. This paper analyses how the fair use doctrine of copyright law as a tool that can help bridge these two cultures and create a more open discourse in art history.</ab>

        <ab>This case study reflects on the process of investigating the appropriateness of pursuing an approval plan at the R. B. House Undergraduate Library at UNC-Chapel Hill. The study highlights the thought processes of library administration, the approach that was taken to analyze the collection and determine areas of strength and weakness, and the steps the library plans to employ now that the decision has been made to adopt an approval plan. The study is intended to serve as a guide for other undergraduate libraries with similar concerns about their collection and considering the implementation of an approval plan. The study used a list of the holdings of the collection at the undergraduate library generated from the Integrated Library System. The list was then analyzed to determine checkout rates, call number ranges, and the extent of duplication between the undergraduate collection and the collection for the main campus library.</ab>

        <ab>Twitter research provides a unique opportunity to answer fundamental questions regarding the best methods for the large-scale retrieval of extremely sparse documents. This study examines the utility of user-generated metadata expansion candidate terms for the creation of precise microblog search engines. Several search engines were created utilizing different genres of candidate expansion terms, confidence thresholds, and document parameters to explore this issue. This study demonstrates that user-generated metadata has utility for the precise retrieval of terse queries with high levels of associated conversation, such as movie awards or current events, but performs poorly on textually rich queries with lower levels of perceived conversation.</ab>

        <ab>This study collected disaster plans from a systematic sample of twenty-seven libraries at small, liberal arts colleges chosen from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Ten of the twenty-seven college libraries that were contacted provided written disaster plans. A list of seventeen requisite criteria constituting a well-designed disaster plan was formed, and the contents in each of the plans were analyzed to see if they included or excluded each of the criterion. It was found that two of the seventeen criteria were met in all of the plans, while another two of the criteria were mentioned in fifty-percent of the plans. The remaining results all fall somewhere in between those two percentages. Previous studies had indicated that 20% of academic libraries have written disaster plans in place. Thirty-seven percentage of the libraries contacted in this study had written disaster plans, and their plans were very likely to include some of the most important elements of a library disaster plan.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines how public libraries can best use social media as a marketing tool, specifically focusing on Facebook. Data was collected from 30 public library Facebook pages on number of posts, number of comments, and number of likes received during a two month period. This data was used to create a model that could fairly accurately predict how many likes a public library's Facebook page would receive based on several factors. Findings of this study suggest that a public library can effectively cultivate public interest through social media by posting to social media sites frequently, allowing for comments on social media sites, and posting about career achievements of current staff members.</ab>

        <ab>This study measures the impact of authenticity -- the operation of one's true self in one's daily activities -- on student engagement and learning in one specific library context, information literacy instruction for English 105 classes at the House Undergraduate Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A classroom modeling exercise was developed to help students choose authentic topics of interest. Students then filled out a questionnaire to assess whether choosing authentic topics led to (a) increased engagement and (b) increased learning according to ACRL information literacy standards. The data collected shows that the exercise successfully helped students choose authentic topics and that these students' motivation to learn was higher than students in the control group. Students in the experimental group also on average rated their learning of ACRL information literacy standards higher than students in the control group. The study provides initial evidence for the positive impact authenticity can have on student motivation and learning in the context of information literacy instruction.</ab>

        <ab>This study explored the connection between fandom and library and information science by means of a focus group and survey of individuals who are members of both fandom and the LIS community, in order to better understand the long-term effects of participating in fandom within this group. I hypothesized that participating in fandom will have in some cases provided an affinity space for LIS students and professionals to learn and practice skills usually associated with LIS professions. This proved to be true, but the most valuable aspect of fandom as suggested by the responses of study participants was social rather than skill-based.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents an exploratory case study of definitions, or assertions, of the Iron Age and its subdivisions consisting of name, date range, location, and source within two broadly defined geographic regions. The collected assertions represent a period label--the Iron Age--that would appear in an authoritative database of time periods that does not require a controlled vocabulary. Assertions were gathered from archaeological literature and related sources. Results showed that date ranges for the Iron Age varied both by region and scholar. Subdivisions within the Iron Age are also named differently depending on the geographic area. Consolidating definitions for an authority file would cause loss of information. This study is intended to address the role of authority files in temporal metadata in order to contribute generally to an understanding of appropriate metadata.</ab>

        <ab>Prior literatures have shown that American public libraries have made an effort to provide trustworthy health information to their users in diverse ways such as reference services, reader advisement, and acquisition of health materials. In that manner, this paper primarily deals with the assessment of health information provided on North Carolina public libraries websites focusing on teenager users. Results have shown that only 31.3% of public library websites in NC provide health resources focusing on adolescent users. In terms of resources' specified topics, resources cover a variety of health issues including not only general health but also sensitive teen issues such as sexual health, drugs and alcohols, STDs, self-abuse, and birth control. When it comes to the evaluation of the health information provided on NC public libraries websites, 39 teen health resources out of total forty-five (86.67%) were determined either 'strongly reliable' or 'reliable' online sources. Despite a few limitations, this author believes that findings are appropriate for basing future research of assessing teen health information in public library settings.</ab>

        <ab>Graphic materials such as comic books, graphic novels and manga are an expanding section within most library collections. This study defines graphic materials and examines the role of ratings systems and subjective rating assignment by librarians in the acquisition and collection process. While publishers of such graphic materials provide rating systems for librarians to use when making acquisition and placement decisions, these rating systems are not uniform. This leads to the librarian relying upon professional judgment along with review resources and knowledge of the community served by the library. The author has concluded that librarians self-rate graphic materials consistent with the publisher ratings 50% of the time. Data also shows that a further 30% of the time librarians will rate graphic materials for a younger age than the publishers. Misplacement in the public library, according to the interview information, is a rare occurrence.</ab>

        <ab>This study used content analysis to examine texts that depict characters with scoliosis for readers aged 10-14. The purpose of this study was to examine how scoliosis and characters with scoliosis are portrayed in literature available to adolescents. Specifically, this paper investigated what books are readily available to readers, whether or not scoliosis is described with medical accuracy, and how characters with scoliosis respond to and cope with their diagnosis and treatment. This study found twelve relevant titles, with only three available in public libraries. Overall, the books were found to be medically accurate; however, this study found many of the books to be overly focused on facts to the detriment of the story.</ab>

        <ab>Many libraries, particularly large academic libraries, have begun major digitization projects in order to make library material much more widely available. However, many works that might otherwise be candidates for digitization are protected by copyright. While this does not completely bar a work from being digitized, it becomes a much more complicated process if permission is required. This research studies how academic library digitization projects have addressed copyrighted materials. Librarians and publishers were interviewed to understand their perspective on copyright and to determine the best practices for locating and contacting copyright holders. Overall, there is no one best technique for finding copyright holders, but there are ways that librarians can expedite the process, such as by developing a good workflow at the outset and consulting with administration. Overall, institutions have been successful in incorporating copyright items into a digitization project, although a heavy time investment is involved.</ab>

        <ab>In keeping with the aims of the Affordable Care Act to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has instituted the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which penalizes hospitals that report readmissions rates that exceed predetermined expectations. This paper outlines the causes of the readmissions dilemma and then considers the parameters of the HRRP as well as the major objections to its methodology, before moving to a discussion of intervention strategies hospitals can implement in order to achieve compliance. Health information technology tools and solutions play a significant role in helping to prevent undue rehospitalizations, and this paper concludes with an overview of several of the most prevalent means of leveraging electronic resources to curb readmissions.</ab>

        <ab>Folk ontologies are the organically created, crowd-managed ontology-like structures used to organize information in wikis. This paper takes as case studies the folk ontologies of the wikis Wikipedia and TV Tropes, performing a three-part analysis on them. The first part describes the folk ontologies and examines how they are maintained and used. The second part creates an evaluation framework based on the ontology evaluation literature and considers the folk ontologies in that light. The third part takes a random sample of pages from the wiki and performs a quantitative analysis looking at where and how the folk ontologies appear and what effects their presence has. The goal of the paper is to advance our understanding of how people, in aggregate, organize information.</ab>

        <ab>Selection guides are essential tools in libraries because they help librarians determine which books to purchase for their collections. A popular selection aide in the Health Sciences is Doody's Core Titles (DCT), which provides quantifiable scores for each book. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent these scores correlate with usage by library patrons. A list of all e-books on the DCT list at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Health Sciences Library was compiled and circulation data was obtained. Statistical calculations, including correlation coefficients, were performed in order to determine if a statistically significant relationship between DCT scores and usage exists. The data were also examined for other trends in e-book usage. While this study was not able to conclusively prove a relationship between DCT score and usage, in general, books with higher DCT scores are used more frequently.</ab>

        <ab>African American adolescent females are looking for representations of themselves in the young adult titles they read. Looking at a database of recommended titles and a popular teen series, the main objective of this study is to perform a content analysis on contemporary young adult titles that feature female African American characters. Specifically this study hopes to provide insight into how adolescent African American females are represented in contemporary young adult literature. Findings suggest that when an adolescent African American female is in a main role, they are portrayed as multidimensional and complex. However, adolescent African American females in supporting roles are underdeveloped and tend to fall into one of four types: the sister role, the object of affection role, the moral compass role, or the expositor role.</ab>

        <ab>While video games have been around for decades, the academic study of video games and their creation is fairly recent. Academic programs in video game design blend artistic and technical prowess with a knowledge of the field to train future creators of this form of entertainment. This study investigates the information behavior of a group of 11 video game design undergraduates at one academic institution utilizing focus group interviews and qualitative analysis. Major findings include their need for technique and how-to information related to computer programs such as ZBrush and Unreal Development Kit as well as a need for inspiration and specific visual references. These students rely heavily on web and social resources for troubleshooting assistance and to stay updated about new developments or artists in the field. From the findings, suggestions are made for academic librarians to collect and serve this unique user group.</ab>

        <ab>Government use of social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter, has become common practice over the last five years. However, as governments adopt social media tools as a way to connect with citizens, these efforts fall short of creating meaningful engagement. Government Fan Pages emphasize government driven, one-way information dissemination instead of two-way collaboration and exchange with citizens. This paper looks at a sample of North Carolina city government Facebook Pages to identify features that support two-way interactions between government and citizens that may contribute to increased engagement and participation.</ab>

        <ab>In this exploratory research paper, the popular social tagging system site, Pinterest, is examined through the lens of narrative metadata creation. Based on content analysis taken from a selected sample of 'pinboard' names from Pinterest, and set names from Flickr this research analyzed the types of names given by users. With a specific focus on the use of Hubble Space Telescope images, encompassing ten named items from each site, this paper found that the social network aspect of the Pinterest leads users to express themselves through their choice of 'pinboard' names. In contrast, Flickr users relied on naming conventions that were more descriptive of the image content.</ab>

        <ab>Homo sapiens are a species obsessed with the classification of objects. From the various jars of Mesopotamia, to the Forms of Plato, to the Dewey Decimal System, civilization has made great strides as a species to organize the world. The modern world allows people to organize large amounts of information like never before with unrivaled accuracy. However, people often struggle to create new taxonomies and ontologies to satisfy their need to sort objects, and often find it difficult to merge new or updated information into taxonomies designed for a previous era or set of information. This paper will examine how various people and organizations have dealt with these problems of ontologies and classifications, while providing recommendations for each scenario.</ab>

        </sug>
        <ab>Wikis allow users to collaboratively create and maintain content. As a new platform for wiki sites, Semantic wikis provide additional means to annotate the content to add structure. These Semantic Wiki sites are experiencing an enormous increase in popularity because structured data is more usable and thus more valuable than unstructured data. This study proposes the use of a semantic wiki to develop an web portal to collect and organize the information maintained in an Enterprise's content management system. The ontology selected to support the conceptual infrastructure of the portal is based on a scheme inspired from an IFLA proposition known as Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR). The paper introduces a model for the specification of mappings between FRBR entities and the organization's information artifacts. Also, the information system stakeholders - process owners, document creators, SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), support reps, end users, etc.- are also defined and interrelated using simple standard ontologies and vocabularies such as Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF), RDF and OWL. The FRBR ontology and the web portal are developed using the platform provided by Semantic MediaWiki, an extension of MediaWiki, the platform for Wikipedia. The main features for standard vocabularies integration and semantic queries and searches are summarized. Finally, a number of metrics and indicators are presented as a reference for the portal's project managers and sponsors to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the tool and help them make decisions about future initiatives, enhancements and new information requirements implementation.</ab>

Results showed that slightly more than half of respondents had read the Code. Those who had read it were likely to agree that it was relevant and useful to their library's mission, but they did not report relying on fair use in copyright-related decision making at a higher rate than those who had not.</ab>

Motivations for the project are presented along with a review of pertinent literature. User research consisted of a focus group with graduate students in a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill history pedagogy course and contextual inquiry interviews with a group of students from an undergraduate history course, which gave insight into the goals, skills, and strategies expert and novice historians use and the differences between those groups' methods. Moderated formative usability evaluation was conducted with another group of undergraduates enrolled in the same course. A paper prototype was used to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of their experience. Wireframes and interaction diagrams of the prototype are also presented.</ab>

        <ab>This study compares the overall population statistics for Oregon public libraries to programing numbers for Oregon public libraries between the years of 2007-2011 and takes a.deeper look comparing the population statistics and the programing numbers for Oregon public libraries divided by three age groups, Adults, Young Adults, and Children. The US population is increasingly mobile, community demographics can change significantly year to year. It is important for libraries to do their best to monitor and stay abreast of changes in their communities to best serve their communities. The results of this study indicated that roughly 47% of Oregon counties have some amount of disconnect between their population changes and public library programing number changes though the five year period between 2007 and 2011. Among the age groups there was a larger disconnect between teen and children population and programing then for adults.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a review of subject guide use at Appalachian State University. All guides are created in LibGuides, a software widely used by academic libraries today. Pageview statistics were tracked from May 2009 through December 2012 to see which guides received higher use. Statistics were kept by LibGuides and Google Analytics. This study divided the subject guides into two categories: Guides focusing on broad subject matter and those designed around a specific course. The idea behind the study is to see which type of guide receives higher usage. This is based around the need that course specific subject guides see more use because they fit better with users' information seeking behavior. Ten guides of each type were analyzed and in nearly every case course specific guides saw more monthly pageviews than general subject guides.</ab>

        <ab>This paper looks at two tools that libraries can use to better reflect the service provided during reference transactions. The first tool is a six point scale called the READScale. The READScale allows librarians to assign a point value to reference transactions. The second tool is a project management software developed by Atlassian called JIRA, that libraries can customize to use for reference transactions. This easily customized software allows librarians to capture and store more information about reference transactions and can be used in conjunction with the READScale or independently. Information that can be collected include requestor, department or office of requestor, time to complete transaction, type of transaction, and any other information the library deems valuable. Having the data from these two tools provides the library with quantitative data they can use to demonstrate their value to decision makers.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines early public library services to blind adults in the United States. While blind adults had access to library services beginning in the late nineteenth century, these services were limited, especially outside of urban areas in the northeast and California. The establishment of a uniform raised type and advances in printing technology made it possible for libraries for the blind to fill their shelves. However, patrons' dependence on receiving books through the mail resulted in the creation of a national library service with regional distribution centers. Studying how public libraries adapted to meet the needs of a new user group in the early twentieth century may help librarians think about how to meet the needs of today's underserved populations.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults are using the internet more than ever before for work, information seeking, and recreation. Public libraries have expanded their services to provide free computer and internet access along with instruction in technology. To improve, expand, and justify these programs, libraries need effective assessment techniques. This study surveyed 26 adults attending computer classes at a mid-sized public library using the Attitudes Toward Computers Instrument. Using a pre-test/post-test method the impact of instruction was measured. Participants showed a positive increase in their attitudes on seven of eight measures, both directly after class and one week afterwards. There was no impact on the use of computers. Based on these results future computer classes at this location will emphasize repetition, risk control, formative assessment, and engagement.</ab>

        <ab>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews is a source of practical medical information. Systematic reviews summarize the best current research in a field to provide a timely peer reviewed professional summary. These reviews are available through Cochrane.org. This study examines the Cochrane Systematic Reviews by surveying its content to see if it expands the medical literature of effective health practice. How often are articles outside the publication characteristics of the JAMA, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews? Previous work on JAMA article characteristics were reviewed, along with published restrictions including length and number of works cited. The Cochrane Systematic review articles were compared to see how many of them are at variance with JAMA. Particularly interesting are publication biases toward conclusive studies that have been documented to undermine previously published results. Combining inconclusive studies with length restrictions there is no overlap in the two collections.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the role of illuminated manuscript facsimiles in the research process of art historians focusing on the medieval and Byzantine periods, exploring this role in comparison with other illuminated manuscript reproductions, such as digital facsimiles, surveys, and monographs. Through interviews with art historians and study of the reproductions themselves, it was concluded that the full context of the work is crucial, and that manuscript reproductions must come as close as possible to reproducing the experience of handling the art-object-as-book to serve their intended purpose. Additionally, the trend of resource-guided research appeared, a circumstance in which the facsimiles available to the art historian guided or determined their course of study. Finally, art historians used different kinds of image resources for different information needs, suggesting the importance of developing, providing, and advertising a variety of resources that incorporate the experiential context of the original manuscript.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study is to understand usability of the web interface of the Lifetime Library, a shared storage system provided by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Eight participants were recruited and were asked to perform a number of file management tasks, such as uploading a file, renaming a file, creating a folder, adding a tag, adding metadata, organizing a folder, and deleting a file, by using the Lifetime Library web interface. Task completion rate, task completion time, perceived difficulty, confidence in completion of task, number of clicks, and comments were collected to understand each task's usability. Partcipants' responses were measured using the System Usability Scale, and written comments were gathered to understand overall usability of the system. From the results, it was found that bulk uploading was the most difficult task for all participants. It was also found that the longer a task takes time to complete, the higher the tendency to perceive the task as difficult. The results of the study suggested areas for improvement in the usability of the current system, such as placement of menu items, consistency between the main menu and the side bar menu, clear right-click menu, and visibility of notification messages.</ab>

        <ab>Web-based research guides are a major service provided by academic libraries, which require a significant investment of staff time to create and maintain. These guides, however, are not heavily used. Librarians need to understand the factors influencing the use a guide receives in order to make improvements that will increase usage. The literature suggests many design standards for guides to follow, but no quantitative assessment has been undertaken to determine whether good design really does increase research guide use. In a case study of LibGuides at Kennesaw State University, use of guides is regressed against a specific list of design and usability standards based on the library science and web design literature. The results demonstrate the effect each variable has on use and how well design predicts use overall. A list of standard design recommendations is presented, and other factors influencing guide use are also considered.</ab>

        <ab>This project examined open access digital repositories in Mexico. The results are based on data drawn from repository websites and guided by three research questions: 1) How do Mexican repositories promote or encourage the development of national standards for preservation of digital information? 2) Are Mexican repositories and their content easily accessible within their host institutions and on the Web? 3) Can repositories serve to promote collaboration and establish connections between scholars? Examining repositories revealed that nearly all rely on software and metadata developed outside of Mexico but that many do take a role in advancing the discussion about digital preservation. Repositories had mixed levels of web visibility, both within their own institution and on the web. Some of the larger repositories that draw from multiple institutions incorporate features that might promote collaboration, but this is less common among repositories focused solely on the research output of one institution.</ab>

        <ab>This study discusses how DNA testing can help genealogists and family historians further their research and go beyond their paper trail in validating the identity of their ancestors. It looks at the three kinds of DNA tests, their value to genealogical research, and their limitations. Several case studies for each type of testing are also presented. The three kinds of DNA testing are mitochondrial, Y-DNA, and autosomal. The mitochondrial DNA is passed down from a mother to her children and is useful in determining the direct maternal ancestry. The Y-DNA is passed down only from a father to his son and is useful in determining the direct paternal ancestry. The autosomal DNA is passed down from both the mother and the father and is useful in determining recent ancestry from all ancestors. The kind of DNA test taken depends on the researchers' goals. A genealogical paper trail is still required to understand and work with the results of a DNA test and to further one's research. A DNA test by itself cannot identify who one's ancestors were; however, when used in tandem with genealogical research, it can help to build a clearer picture of who they might have been.</ab>

        <ab>The Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary that will be used to describe music resources and is developed by the Music Library Association in conjunction with the Library of Congress. The objective of this study is to report on the current status of the LCMPT and to outline future steps which will allow the thesaurus to operate in a linked data environment. Four research questions examined the Simple Knowledge Organization System and its use with the LCMPT: the ways in which controlled vocabularies can be transformed into the Simple Knowledge Organization System format, the technologies and methods currently in use for this process, the effectiveness of these technologies and methods, and how the LCMPT can be most effectively converted into the Simple Knowledge Organization System format. Using existing documents, this qualitative study examined official World Wide Web Consortium documentation, the Open Metadata Registry, and was informed by work on the LCMPT performed at the Library of Congress. Tasks completed during an internship at the Library of Congress included discussion and planning for further LCMPT development and progress, development of the LCMPT Authority Data Elements, consideration of existing technologies and how they might be used in the development and deployment of LCMPT, conversion of existing LCMPT documentation into a more accessible format, research and documentation of the hierarchy of LCMPT, deployment of the LCMPT to a vocabulary space and element set space in the Open Metadata Registry, and consideration for future development of the LCMPT. The results of this study help to determine whether applying Semantic Web tools such as the Simple Knowledge Organization System to the LCMPT will allow music catalogers and other users of controlled vocabularies to begin harnessing the many potential benefits of the Semantic Web.</ab>

        <ab>Current research shows that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) teenagers are being physically and mentally harassed at an extremely high rate. School libraries are in a position to support LGBTQ teens by collecting and promoting LGBTQ themed literature and resources. This study investigates the availability of positive, appropriate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) themed internet resources from behind the filtering systems at high schools in North Carolina. The results were mixed; some schools blocked none of the websites included in the study, while others blocked as many as fifteen.</ab>

A survey of 215 people showed that most people, after joining fandom, read, write and create art more than they did before. It also revealed that young people in fandom believe their lives to have been significantly shaped by the support, feedback and inspiration that the friends they make in fandom communities give them.</ab>

        <ab>Cultural institutions are using social media, like Twitter, to promote digitized primary source collections to teachers. With so many resources dedicated to social media outreach, it is necessary to examine the effectiveness of cultural institutions' outreach to teachers. This study examines the Twitter messages produced by three U.S. cultural institutions and identifies the relationship between message characteristics and the perceived value of the messages by K-12 teachers. A content analysis of tweets selected from the Twitter timelines of the Smithsonian institution, National Archives and Records Administration, and the National Endowment of Humanities education outreach departments identified the types of content produced by these cultural institutions. Categories that emerged from the content analysis were used to develop a survey to explore the value of the tweets to teachers. This study provides insight into the use of Twitter messages for outreach to teachers and offers recommendations for improving Twitter outreach to teachers.</ab>

        <ab>The recent Open Government Initiative represents an unprecedented commitment to make the U.S. government more transparent, collaborative, and participatory. As the President recently suggested, "Proper records management is the backbone of open government." This paper explores the interface of Open Government and records management, and examines some of the challenges and opportunities it engenders. Its central thesis proposes the Open Government movement may provide an opportunity for improved recordkeeping by shining a light on long-standing deficiencies. While federal agencies have been mandated to comply with specific policy provisions, there is a clear need to reform the recordkeeping practices of government agencies to preserve our nation's valuable documentary history, and ensure transparent and accountable governance.</ab>

        <ab>This study collected survey data from researchers that deposited phylogenetic data in the Dryad and TreeBASE data repositories in order to better understand the factors that most influence where researchers deposit their data. Respondents were asked to rank the relative importance of eight possible factors. I found that there were strong preferences within the larger sample of TreeBASE users, and that the rankings differed significantly between TreeBASE and Dryad users. On average, TreeBASE users ranked the specialization of the repository highest and Dryad users ranked as equally highest the trust in the persistence of the repository and the ease of the data submission process. Being directed to choose a repository by a journal policy had the greatest frequency of being ranked as the most important factor in both user groups, but had a bimodal ranking distribution. Some users reported depositing their data in multiple repositories and archiving their data voluntarily.</ab>

        <ab>This report describes a survey of current User Experience (UX) practitioners to establish the value of a strong portfolio during the job application process, and to define what features create a strong portfolio. Responses were collected via a formal survey distribution, informal informational interviews, and a literature review of formal publications and professional blogs. During data collection, all levels of industry were consulted, from local, national, and international development firms. Nearly every UX position advertised carries the note that a portfolio review is a necessary component of candidate selection. As such, portfolio creation is a large part of professional development and a critical component of the application process for current and future UX designers. However, portfolio creation remains an art form, and can be difficult for inexperienced designers to tackle without guidance and preparation.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the online presence of theological libraries. The sample of libraries was selected from schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. A content analysis of the library websites was done measuring the presence of many elements including OPACs, databases, reference services, and social media. It was found that while certain elements are near universal, others are still used by only a minority of theological libraries. However, in comparison to the past, the online presence of theological libraries has clearly developed. It is likely that it will continue to do so in the future.</ab>

        <ab>This paper focuses on cloud storage industry analysis. Some products of public cloud storage providers are main objects: Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive and etc. Based on system dynamics, the study represents a whole map of cloud storage stakeholders. In addition, price and storage space as two main factors are researched to illustrate current situation. Using Vensim simulates future number of users about Google Drive. The result shows that Google Drive has a flexible pricing strategy and Dropbox is a security system. However, most factors are hard to digitize. In the future, user satisfaction test will help system simulation better.</ab>

        <ab>The study focuses on how people use their cloud storage and manage their personal information. Since many cloud storage services allow users to share documents, this study also examines how people manage documents when working collaboratively. There are many cloud storage providers in the market, but this study focuses on two specific systems -- Dropbox and Google Drive. The research was conducted by interviews and the results show that with the differently designed interfaces and functions of cloud storage, people developed diverse ways to use them. Participants stored different types of files and practiced different management strategies because of different purposes and reasons. Aspects of the system and user interface also impacted how users managed files. When working on collaborative and shared documents, participants reported tending to not manage files because they prefer following others' decisions or due to a lack of motivation to manage them.</ab>

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty participants, and each participant was asked questions on their previous experience with the mobile version of UNC library catalog, their purposes of using it, their library search tasks conducted on it, and their future expectations from it. Results indicate that participants think the mobile library catalog is convenient under certain circumstances and they prefer to conduct simple and quick library search tasks on it. However, the study produces some results contradicting a few previous studies on mobile information needs and mobile information behaviors.</ab>

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill online library catalog was used as a case study. In order to explore this question, interface and literature reviews were conducted along with a semi-structured interview of catalog users. Additionally, the overall design of the catalog was evaluated in terms of helpfulness when searching for non-book items.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on how non-expert assessors judge relevance guided by mental models of relevance developed and applied during the assessment process. Components of relevance models are identified as well as challenges and changes associated with their construction and use. Study participants evaluated the relevance of news articles with respect to an assigned search topic. They commented on their reasoning in assessing each article, challenges they experienced in determining relevance and changes in their ability to assess relevance over the course of the evaluation session. Content analysis of these comments revealed that relevance models are derived from participants' understandings of the search topic, the documents they viewed and the relationships between them. Relevance manifestations (topical, situational, cognitive) and criteria (information scope, specificity and detail) guide the development and application of the relevance models, which may also be influenced by situational, cognitive and motivational factors.</ab>

        <ab>Two groups of American publishers, and their allies, in two different centuries faced one common problem--how could they control the retail price of a book in a marketplace where some retailers sold books at break even or at a loss? At the tum of the twentieth century, publishers formed the American Publishers' Association and created an alliance with the American Booksellers Association to "maintain" the retail prices of their publications. In 2009, five major publishers worked with Apple, Inc. to create a new pricing system that significantly increased the retail price of e-books. This paper documents the rise and fall of publishers' pricing schemes through two major antitrust cases: Straus v. American Publishers' Association (231 U.S. 222) and U.S. v. Apple, Inc. (Civil Action No. 12-cv-2826 (DLC)).</ab>

        <ab>Copyright law is the legal foundation for the existence and activities of libraries in the U.S. Yet the library field knows little about the day to day practices, experiences, and perceptions of librarians as they interact with the complexities of copyright law in the context of the collections and services of their institutions and the activities of the patrons they serve. Building on a literature review tracing the historical and legal context for contemporary library practice and the practice mandates of copyright law, this exploratory research study surveyed the chief executives of the fifty state library agencies in the U.S. to collect qualitative data on professional practices related to copyright law and risk management, institutional experiences in navigating copyright, and librarian perceptions of their professional roles and responsibilities in the copyright law landscape.</ab>

        <ab>This study sought to determine whether single-color, "flat" icons would be more quickly and accurately selected by users when presented in either a filled-in or outline style. An application was developed that allowed participants to take a test measuring their speed and accuracy in selecting prompted icons from an array of distractors. The test was made available on the web and was completed by 1,260 participants. Averaged across the 20 unique icon forms used in the test, the outline style led to slightly longer task times, but only when icons were displayed in white against a black background. For individual icons, the effects of icon style were inconsistent and, except for a few exceptions, quite small. This study concluded that one icon style is not objectively better than the other.</ab>

To make a user's participation on the social platform more relevant, recommending a hashtag would help a user participate better. This study is an attempt to build a recommender system for hashtag recommendation, and to further study the textual features around hashtags, which assist in their retrieval. The suggested system performs better for tweets with longer text; those with a URL, with multiple hashtags and those that have user mentions.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes the decisions and methodology behind creating a website to instruct interns at Ullman Library, which serves the Classics Department at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, in the skills necessary to perform book repairs. The department desires that its staff perform repairs on the materials in the library, but currently has no way of teaching those skills. The website constructed provides a context for knowledge sharing that was previously lacking and an informational, easily updateable reference source for the library.</ab>

        <ab>This study addresses how scholars working in the digital humanities understand the data and digital objects they use and produce in the course of their research. Through semi-structured interviews, the researcher investigates whether the concept of significant properties, drawn from the field of digital preservation, can serve as a useful heuristic for communicating with humanities scholars when seeking to offer them digital curation support. Results showed that humanities scholars tend to view their digital data and research products holistically, rather than as decomposable units.</ab>

        <ab>This paper documents the process of building Mapping Early NC Lebanese Households, a public digital humanities project that uses census data to map Lebanese immigrants in select North Carolina cities from 1900 to 1930. Built by the Digital Innovation Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the project is an interactive digital component of Cedars in the Pines, a museum exhibit organized by the Khayrallah Program for Lebanese-American Studies at North Carolina State University. The project also represents an effort to develop generalizable workflows and processes for collaborative digital mapping projects. This paper argues for the importance of documenting and sharing the decisions, workflows, and processes behind digital humanities projects as a means of transparency. Finally, the paper suggests ways to extend the features of DH Press, the humanities data visualization toolkit used to build the project.</ab>

        <ab>The North Carolina Digital Heritage Center's website, DigitalNC.org, has provided access to digitized cultural heritage materials from many small North Carolinian museums and libraries since its inception in 2003. The current website has been in use since that time, and is in sore need of usability analysis prior to a major redesign effort. The current DigitalNC.org site design is the only way for contributing institutions and researchers to access the digitized materials online, making access and use of the website via its design of paramount importance to the NCDHC's mission. No data has been collected about the usability of the site thus far. This usability study will help to collect data to inform a user-centered redesign of the current DigitalNC.org site. Furthermore, data collected will provide quantitative information to help create a hierarchy of priority for any perceived issues with the current interface. This study was designed using guidelines developed by Jakob Nielsen and Steve Krug. The guidelines developed by these two usability experts were used in this case because they are intended to be implemented in instances when usability testing needs to be inexpensive, iterative, and lean.</ab>

        <ab>Librarian characters in popular culture media are often viewed as stereotypes. However, these characters actually make up a new set of archetypes of the Librarian. First, literature reveals three common trends in professional and academic articles regarding librarian stereotyping in popular media: identification and discussion of 2 main stereotypes; librarian characters in popular culture; and male librarians in popular culture. Next, 5 new archetypes and several sub-archetypes are proposed, followed by examples and explanations of shared traits to prove their validity as everyday archetypes. These examples are studied using close readings of characters from popular media, and a combined lens of Interpretational Phenomenological Analysis, Reader-Response Theory, and Archetypal Criticism. Finally, this paper suggests that it is more constructive to view past and future librarian characters through the lens of these archetypes, rather than assuming they are negative stereotypes.</ab>

        <ab>This study used an online survey of academic library staff in the southeastern United States to explore what web and/or software development skills are used by library staff whose job responsibilities include those areas; where and when such staff members learn these skills; and, for those with Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degrees, how useful LIS courses were in acquiring these skills. Survey results reveal discrepancies between the development skills learned through LIS programs and skills used on the job. They also indicate that academic library staff who have an MLIS degree found LIS courses to be the least useful among various instructional methods for acquiring development skills. This research may help guide changes in LIS curricula to better meet the needs of aspiring academic web librarians, help such students discern what course of study will be most useful, and suggest priorities for on-the-job training for web librarians.</ab>

The study investigates the student's knowledge of health and Wellness materials at the UNC-CH libraries and whether or not the students would be likely to use these materials more if they were located at the student recreation centers. The study found that the majority of respondents were not aware of the health and Wellness materials at the library on campus. The study also found that the responses given for whether or not the students would be likely to use health and Wellness materials at the student recreation centers were inconclusive and indicates a need for further study.</ab>

        <ab>The demand for high quality metadata is growing in response to the massive growth of digital information and data. Traditionally, keywords and other metadata have been created by authors and professional indexers. However, manual metadata generation is increasingly insufficient, due to the digital information explosion and the growth of multidisciplinary digital environments. There is a growing need to develop, study, and advance knowledge about tools that automatically generate metadata, particularly tools that reach across different disciplines. This study addresses this need by introducing "HIVE" which supports automatic metadata generation by drawing descriptors from multiple SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization Systems) encoded controlled vocabularies. First, HIVE's core components and key concepts are defined and discussed. Next, this study describes the step-by-step process of adding new controlled vocabularies into the HIVE demo at RENCI.org. The paper concludes by showing the result of the step-by-step process and addressing further steps of the HIVE project.</ab>

        <ab>To understand the current state of accessioning procedures in manuscript collecting repositories, a study of the 97 American university members of the Association of Research Libraries was conducted. Results show that accessioning procedures are far from codified. While nearly all repositories report the existence of standard accessioning procedures, only 60% are documented in writing. Deeds of gift are employed by all respondents when acquiring a new collection from a donor; however, a formulaic approach to soliciting contextual information about the creator or donor is rare.</ab>

        <ab>Online outreach efforts are increasingly important to the relevance of digital library and archives collections; such efforts have great potential to create new audiences for these collections and encourage users to engage with digital content. However, these online outreach activities are frequently under-appreciated and currently under-studied. By considering the background of online outreach, past and present attitudes towards outreach, definitions of outreach itself, methods for measuring the success of outreach programs, and finally examining and evaluating the online outreach activities of the recent Triangle Research Library Network "Content, Context, and Capacity" project, this paper hopes to further the understanding of and enthusiasm for online outreach as a valuable resource for the archives community.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores the BitTorrent file sharing technology as a means for the construction of a digital library by a community of decentralized internet users. The private BitTorrent tracker What.CD, which currently has over 100,000 users, is the primary focus of the paper. In addition to an overview of the BitTorrent protocol, a detailed analysis of the facets and features of What.CD serves to demonstrate how the collaboration of users contributing their own content via a file sharing website can build an unparalleled library of digital media. It examines the role of authority and privilege at a private BitTorrent tracker, as well as the methods employed by What.CD to maintain a large and well-structured catalog of content produced by a community of anonymous users around the globe.</ab>

        <ab>Electronic records are creating new challenges for state records units. These units are tasked with assisting state agencies with their public records. Electronic public records require new approaches to both day-to-day management and long-term preservation. As records units try to address these issues, they often face bureaucratic barriers. This research paper adapts public administration literature focused on three organizational frameworks including structural, political, and human resources to offer recommendations on how records units can create electronic records management solutions that records creators will adopt. Twelve records management practitioners from 11 different states were interviewed for this study. Their responses were used to develop recommendations on how to implement electronic record-keeping initiatives keeping in mind some of the challenges created by the institutional structures and cultures of state government.</ab>

        <ab>Nineteenth century American colleges and universities placed heavy restrictions on their students. Students' academic work was rigidly laid out for them, and college administrators did not feel that students required access to books outside of the textbooks they used in their courses. Thus, undergraduate students were barred from most academic libraries. The students themselves began to form literary societies in order to expand upon their college educations; these societies focused on debating and speech making, skills students did not learn in their coursework. Often the literary societies founded their own libraries, giving student members access both to texts that supplemented their collegiate learning and to modem texts for their extracurricular enjoyment. This paper looks at the history of the literary societies at Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio--the Erodelphian Literary Society and the Miami Union Literary Society--and the libraries they founded, between 1825 and 1873.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study is to understand the varied data needs of molecular level cancer researchers who use light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy to obtain knowledge about cancer on a molecular level. It explores what data tools a sample of researchers are currently using to preserve their data for future access, and the needs of these researchers for depositing their digital research data into digital repositories. Data from the researchers suggest that they understand the need to preserve their raw and compiled data in places outside their laboratory, but they have not fully embraced the idea of depositing it in a repository. This seems most likely due to them not fully understanding what repositories are and what they provide. To increase the use of repositories by this research community, repositories need to promote themselves better and to offer additional services that are specific for the needs of this community.</ab>

        <ab>The implementation and development of a prototype metadata directory to support the discovery and identification of metadata standards, used in scientific research, is reported on. The project was undertaken as an initiative of the Research Data Alliance's Metadata Standards Directory Working Group in 2014 and makes more accessible information about metadata standards used by scientists in a range of disciplines in order to support the exchange, management, curation and preservation of scientific data. Other important benefits include: supporting the reuse of standards to eliminate duplication of effort, and to enable reproducible scientific research. The report examines the design of the directory; including the use of a distributed version control system as a mechanism for content management. A discussion of the sustainability and risks, and a comparison to other collaboratively managed information systems is made. Future features and extensions applicable to the prototype are also addressed.</ab>

        <ab>Standards in data citation are under development. This study assesses how authors cite shared data. A content analysis of 338 articles associated with data in Dryad repository was undertaken to determine if and how authors cite shared data. The author guidelines of 37 journals were also analyzed to determine if journals provide instruction on how to cite shared data. The majority of articles (n=261, 77.22%) did reference shared data. Repository name and DOI (n=254, 75.15%) were the most commonly used metadata elements, and the citations were most often placed in a dedicated data section (n=133, 39.35%). 24 (64.86%) journals did provide instruction on how to structure a reference to shared data. Further work to develop and enforce data citation standards for shared data may be necessary to ensure that data creators and data managers receive due credit and that data are properly indexed and discoverable.</ab>

        <ab>In 2011, the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill installed a 46-inch touchscreen computer in the Manning Hall lobby. After discussing the system's role with stakeholders, a Drupal-based website was developed with the following system goals: showcase the contributed work and accomplishments of current library and information science students, inspire unique and creative student work for the touchscreen, demonstrate educational opportunities to prospective students, provide an introduction for SILS newcomers and when idle, display event announcements or community interest topics. This document is for content editors, site developers, system administrators, and web designers who will maintain and expand the site. The manual is divided into eight sections: Introduction, Overview of Site Navigation and Site Sections, Adding and Editing Content, Basic Site Maintenance and Administration, Overview of Site Technology, Reference for Site Builders/Developers, Reference for Site Designers and Future Work.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents the results of a usability study comparing online video tutorials and online slide show tutorials. This study focused on four basic instructional library tutorials: How to Request a Book from the Library Service Center, How to Recall a Book that is Checked out. How to Create a Document Delivery Account, and How to create a Refworks Account. Patrons were randomly shown two tutorials in video format and two tutorials in slide show format. The goal of this study was to determine whether patrons preferred viewing these tutorials in the video format or in the slide show format. The patrons' ability to complete the specified task after watching the two types of tutorials was also measured. Results of this study identify areas where the online tutorials could be improved and suggest recommendations for changes.</ab>

        <ab>Courses aimed at science majors may have different needs and expectations for their students than courses within the same departments aimed at non-majors. As such, academic librarians may wish to seek out alternate methods of assessing student and faculty expectations in these fields. Syllabus analysis is a tool that has been used at several libraries to classify the information literacy expected in different classes, and to anticipate student needs. This study will evaluate whether or not syllabus analysis can distinguish between the different requirements of major and general education classes in the various physical sciences.</ab>

        <ab>Despite at any one moment comprising at least half of the human race, women have remained largely invisible in the historical record. This study examines the history of women's collections by analyzing both existing literature and interviews with three women's collections archivists, and uses the findings of this analysis to offer projections and recommendations for the future of collecting and outreach efforts. These recommendations, presented together, can offer a framework for directing women's collections activity in the future to close the gaps left by our predecessors, learn from their mistakes, and build upon their successes. Future research will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these recommendations in a changing women's collections landscape.</ab>

        <ab>The goal of this paper is to evaluate specific event-related Twitter posts, called tweets, for their usability as intelligence data. Using text mining software for Natural Language Processing to attempt to establish the best keyword search strategy for actionable information, 2000 tweets documenting 2 independent events were analyzed. Additionally, the Twitter users who provided the tweets were evaluated for source reliability to determine if their information was likely to be credible. The results of this study suggest that the best information retrieval strategy for tweets featuring reliable and actionable information, is to use hashtagged topics and/or location details as search keywords. Not only is "location" frequently a facet of determining actionability, the co-location of event and user increases the likelihood of a high-reliability source.</ab>

        <ab>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's (UNC) American Indian Center (AIC) serves the campus community, the Native peoples of the state, and the southeastern region of the United States. The purpose of this study was to better understand users' information needs using primarily qualitative methods. A survey was used to understand how users interact with the college culture center. Data about user information needs was collected via questionnaire using the online survey tool Qualtrics. This study will be of practical use to the AIC staff in helping them to understand users' information needs, including which needs are being met and which are not. This study gathered evidence of the value that the AIC adds to UNC and adds to the sparse literature regarding university culture centers.</ab>

Four of the books were published between the years 1990 and 1992, and four were published between the years 2010 and 2012. This study compared differences in sex-typed roles displayed by female protagonists utilizing the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Employing the BSRI, each protagonist was labeled as displayed feminine, masculine, or androgynous behavior. It was found that the books published in the early 1990s displayed clearly sex-typed females, as either masculine or feminine, whereas books published twenty years later displayed androgynous females.</ab>

        <ab>Physicians raise two questions in every three patients they see and around 50% of those questions are not even pursued due to various reasons. These unanswered questions represent huge knowledge gap and could result in less than desirable treatment outcomes. The situation becomes even worse with the emergence of internet technologies which brought explosively increasing information and knowledge into everybody's lives. To make medical information more readily available and to facilitate physicians' decision making process, we designed and developed a medical knowledge summary system that automatically extract and synthesize relevant medical evidence from major resources including UpToDate and PubMed. We performed a pilot usability study to evaluate the effectiveness of the system and used the feedback from physicians to further the development effort. Physicians in general found our system intuitive to use and information delivered very valuable in filling in their knowledge gaps.</ab>

        <ab>This study evaluates the digital redaction process as undertaken by the University of North Carolina Kathrine R. Everett Law Library as part of digitizing their collection of North Carolina Supreme Court briefs. New privacy concerns are raised by digitizing court documents and making them available online. Libraries have an interest in digitizing their print collections of court documents for public access on the Internet, but have received no clear guidance on how to proceed in the face of legal concerns. The purpose of this research is to inform libraries of the legal, ethical, and practical situation surrounding redaction of digitized court documents faced by the UNC Law Library under North Carolina law and to provide libraries with an example of redaction procedures. This research was accomplished through a case study of the UNC Law Library and composed of interviews with the law librarians and observation of the redaction process.</ab>

        <ab>The goal of this project was to design a set of user interfaces to support a Self-Generated Health Information Exchange Market (SGHIx), in which users are given opportunities to share, and manage the sharing of, personal health information gathered from mobile health devices. The interfaces were designed such that the user is fully aware of what information he or she is sharing and with whom. The scope of this project included defining the use cases, designing the associated user interfaces, and then revising the designs after receiving feedback from the project stakeholders.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores, through content analysis, whether twenty-first century children's picture books are accurately portraying twenty-first century libraries. This paper first identifies the characteristics of modem libraries in the areas of library design, library materials, library programs, and finally, in library patrons and librarians themselves. Then, 48 children's picture books published after the year 2000 are examined for these characteristics. It concludes that a majority of the books examined feature patron diversity and include computers, but the presence of librarian diversity, audiovisual materials, programming besides storytime, themed children's spaces, and play areas for young children lag behind.</ab>

        <ab>Rescuing fragile scientific data is crucial to ensuring that this data can continue to be part of the scientific process. The complementary documentation of data rescue efforts is also essential for ongoing scientific study and future data rescue. This paper reports on a study that examined how best to document and describe data rescue activities. A mixed methods approach included a case study of 20 data rescue initiatives and a content analysis of seven descriptive metadata schemes. The results identified 13 metadata elements that were common across schemes and well suited to describing rescue projects. The findings were used to develop a core metadata scheme for the description of data rescue activities. The study was undertaken as part of the Data-at-Risk Initiative (DARI). Results of the study will help inform future DARI efforts and contribute to the knowledge base on data rescue and project-descriptive metadata.</ab>

        <ab>This study analyzes twelve easy reader titles featuring superheroes and their corresponding product reviews on Amazon.com. Titles were examined for difficulty based on language and design features, and the results were compared to assessments made by reviewers on Amazon.com. The study found that reviewers commonly reported use of these easy readers as read aloud material for pre-reading children. Reviewers who indicated use of the book as independent reading material commented on difficulty more often than those who described the book as read aloud material. Series that this study assigned overall higher difficulty scores had comparatively more uses as read aloud material than those that received lower difficulty scores. A content analysis of the Amazon.com reviews revealed that evaluations tended to center on four categories: difficulty, engagement, appropriateness, and female role models. The results of this study may be useful for children's librarians and teachers when considering superhero easy readers for their collections.</ab>

        <ab>In order to comply with best preservation and curation practices, collecting institutions must ensure that private and sensitive information contained in born-digital materials has been properly redacted before the materials are made available. Institutions receiving donor media in the form of hard disks, USB flash drives, compact disks, floppy disks, and even entire computers, are increasingly creating bit-identical copies called disk images. Redacting data from within a disk image currently is a manual, time-consuming task. In this project, I demonstrate the feasibility of automating disk image redaction using open-source, forensic software. I discuss the problems encountered when redacting disk images using automated methods and ways to improve future disk image redaction tools.</ab>

        <ab>This study explored the effectiveness of a classical information retrieval (IR) approach, pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), on improving the performance of microblog search. Factors including number of PRF iterations, term selection strategy, term weighting scheme and use of user-generated metadata were examined in order to shed light on their influence on the effectiveness of the studied approach in an environment of microblog search. An IR system implementing the studied approach was developed for experiments and experiments were conducted on an English microblog corpus composed of Twitter's microblogs, known as tweets. Search performance was evaluated using precision at thirty (P@30), mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain at thirty (NDCG@30).</ab>

        <ab>The University of California Shared Print program, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation Shared Print Repository, and the Triangle Research Libraries Network Collaborative Print Retention Program are studied in order to ascertain current print serial retention practices among academic libraries in the United States. Using a comparative case study design, document analysis and descriptive statistics are examined to reveal the processes of different programs, as well as their local contexts. Cross-case analysis revealed several trends: retention of print journals often builds upon existing consortial mechanisms to gather, describe, preserve, and provide access services, subsequently relieving library budgets as well as space. In the emerging electronic world, these programs are seeking a solution to the problem of print serials by collaborating to retain limited copies--always ensuring some form of basic access, and never closing the door to them completely.</ab>

        <ab>During the fall of 2013 a small group of librarians and graduate student staff at the R.B. House Undergraduate Library, UNC Chapel Hill, began a project to reimagine our online tutorials. Drawing on the literature on instructional explanations, narrative in education, and multimedia learning, we decided to build new tutorials that provide narrative-based explanations related to steps of the research process. Beginning with Developing Your Topic, the videos focus on the larger concepts, principles, and processes related to information literacy, serving as a set of learning objects complementary to classroom instruction. This project details the process of developing the first video, from identifying goals, to drafting the story and script, to creating visuals and recording sound.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the involvement of public health librarians in the deposit of student literature (e.g. theses, journal publications, posters) into university-based institutional repositories. While there is literature about institutional repositories and the roles that librarians can fill related to them, there is limited data as to the actions of librarians in this context. This paper addresses this gap, particularly as it pertains to public health librarians. Twenty-two librarians identified as library liaisons or library contacts for public health students at large, research universities completed a survey on this topic. Overall, the survey results indicate active involvement or interest by public health librarians in the preservation of student scholarly content and imply collaboration with institutional repositories to do so. Further research is needed to determine the extent of librarian involvement in such efforts as well as the degree to which this involvement extends to other groups of librarians.</ab>

        <ab>This study uses a direct content analysis approach to evaluate chapter websites of the Autism Society among the southern United States. With the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), having access to appropriate and correct information is vital. 37 websites across 17 states were evaluated based on standards inspired by previous research on the information needs of families and individuals affected by ASD. The results demonstrate that 4 websites provided content on an excellent level, 21 at a satisfactory level, 9 at a poor level, and 2 were unable to be evaluated. The discrepancy among websites and content for local chapters of the Autism Society suggests the need for an enforced standardization and redesign of chapter websites. This will ensure that searchers using this resource for information have an equal opportunity to resolving their information needs.</ab>

        <ab>In an era when numerous resources previously only available in print are now available electronically, many students and staff see the academic library more as a space to study or even socialize than a place to gather information. As a result, many librarians are renovating their libraries by changing both the library's uses of technology and space in an attempt to increase the library's user base. This study surveyed 71 academic library directors who have renovated their existing library space within the past five years, in an attempt to analyze what changes they made and determine these directors' priorities in terms of space allocation within their libraries. It was found that the majority of these librarians are renovating because of evolving student need and conception of the role of the library. Common problems and complexities of academic library renovation are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>E-books are being acquired at higher and higher rates, especially in disciplines such as the health sciences. Although there have been several studies that analyze the difference in use between electronic and print books, including in health sciences libraries, there has been less focus on the different ways that electronic books might be acquired and how that impacts use. This study analyzed usage and purchase data of e-books at an academic health sciences library to determine whether books purchased in packages, on a individual title-by-title basis, or user requests had the highest instances of use. This information will assist health sciences librarians with book selection and acquisition. It will also provide insight into the use of electronic books generally.</ab>

        <ab>Social sciences data typically consists of a lot of surveys, each with multiple questions. These surveys are mostly in XML format with the size of the file too large to process within the memory of a single machine. The unstructured nature of the data means that relational databases can be used to store and query. Hadoop Map Reduce will be used and evaluated for this large scale data processing due to the way it partitions data across low cost software .The processed data is fed into a NoSQL database like PIG where further grouping is done to see if the surveys can be classified into clusters based on their similarity.</ab>

        <ab>This study looks at the top 10 ranked accredited library and information schools (LIS) across the United States. Document reviews of these 12 LIS schools were conducted to examine their approaches to big data by looking at course work, offered specializations and certificates and employed professors whose focus is within the field. Overall, this study showed that while many are incorporating big data and data management into their programs through courses and by employing professors, there is still room for improvement, especially in regards to offering specializations and certificates. A ranking of each school was completed at the conclusion of the study. The findings of this research may be of interest to incoming LIS students, current LIS students and faculty.</ab>

        <ab>This study seeks to determine the needs of the social science research and information professional communities regarding data management training and education. The needs assessment surveys conducted in this study work towards answering three main questions: How do researchers and the information professionals who serve them understand the term "data management"? What are some of the gaps in data management knowledge of the social science and information professional communities that need to be addressed? What preferences do researchers and information professionals have in regards to data management training and education dissemination methods? An online needs assessment survey was e-mailed to 1,974 participants with a total response rate of 10.5%. The results of this study emphasize a broad understanding of the term "data management" with a focus on storage and sharing, a need for education on long-term data storage best practices and data management tools, as well as a preference for short, online video courses with an open discussion forum.</ab>

        <ab>Research was conducted examining a link between education and training on readers' advisory and confidence levels when conducting the service. A survey was sent to all public libraries in North Carolina. The respondents were asked about their education, training received on the job and their level of confidence when conducting readers' advisory. The results from the survey showed that most library staff did not receive initial or ongoing training. Despite the lack of training, the respondents reported high levels of confidence, comfort and success when performing readers' advisory.</ab>

        <ab>This research explores the current practices, potential methodologies, and user expectations concerning collaborative online filmmaking. Since the concept "Collaborative Online Film Projects (COFPs)" was created for this research and since little research has investigated preservation of online participatory film projects, the paper includes an in-depth review of similar concepts and of literature addressing the preservation of comparable areas of study, including crowdsourced art, interactive virtual worlds, and digital film. The paper reports on a case study of the COFP platform Wreckamovie.com, including semi-structured interviews of individuals involved with the site. I also analyzed other COFP platform examples: the still-active hitRECord.org and the now inactive opensourcecinema.org and the project A Swarm of Angels. Though more research is necessary, this paper concludes that though users value the preservation of their work, there is minimal communication about collaboratively preserving work and little engagement with active preservation.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated African American women's use of social network sites (SNS) with a primary focus on Facebook. Eight African American women from the University of Chapel Hill campus were interviewed to determine how African American women use SNS, what their information seeking needs were when using SNS and what facilitators or barriers they encounter. Based on the results of the study, the data revealed that African American women are prolific users of SNS. There are a variety of reasons that African American women use SNS which include fulfilling both personal and professional needs. Furthermore, participants expressed an overwhelming concern about privacy issues inherent in Facebook as well as advertisements that have no relational or added value to their lives as African American women. These findings demonstrate the importance of expanding the range of study as it relates to the everyday use by African American women of social network sites.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigates the Structural Biology Central Facility at a large academic research institution and examines the Central Facility's most pressing data management needs. The University's Health Affairs Library has undertaken an initiative to pursue data management support for researchers in the biomedical sciences and the central facility has been identified as one of the library's first partners in assessing and proposing data management services the library could provide. Five groups of campus stakeholders that mutually contribute and participate in assisting the structural biology central facility were identified and interviewed to identify contributions to the central facility's data management practices. From these interviews, seven major obstacles were identified around which the Health Affairs Library could develop novel strategies for extending data management services into biomedical research environments.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes an interview and observation-based study on the practices of communities of game players in preserving digital games using disk images and hardware emulators. An emulation-based preservation strategy was built based on the findings from this study. Five hobbyist digital game preservers were interviewed via online text-based chat clients, two online forum-based discussions were conducted, and seven forums and eight websites dedicated to the practice of game preservation and the distribution of disk images or ROMs were read and analyzed. The game players were found to adhere to high standards of authenticity and data integrity and demonstrated a concern that not enough was being done to preserve digital games. The resulting strategy of emulation-based digital preservation derived from their practices could be adapted to the need of a heritage institution. However, more research is necessary before a complete strategy with an appropriate metadata structure adapted to the specific needs of digital games can be developed.</ab>

        <ab>This study analyzes how travelers use the information of travel destination related discussion boards to help make decisions with their vacation purchases. Fifty discussion threads in the large community forum known as DISboards under went a thorough analysis with the help of the American Library Association's information literacy standards to understand what criteria for author credibility and information quality were used and how they were used in order to decide whether the information should be taken into account to assist with purchase decisions. Conclusions could not be reached as results were varied, however, a general trend begins to form showing that DISboard members tend to look for the author's credibility. If the criterion for credibility is positive, the member will learn to trust the author and, therefore, conclude the information pertains a high quality and may be deemed helpful.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is an analysis of the holdings of Lawrence Ferlinghetti's published works from 1955-1975 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Rare Book Collection. The paper includes a biography of the American poet, painter, and publisher, describing life events and publishing highlights. It also contains a section describing Ferlinghetti's connection to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with information about the acquisition of a substantial amount of materials in 2001, due to a combination of funds from the William Whitaker Endowment and a generous gift from Bill Morgan, bibliographer and friend of Ferlinghetti. The bulk of this paper is a descriptive catalog of the Rare Book Collections' holdings of Ferlinghetti works published from 1955-1975, based on Bill Morgan's comprehensive bibliography of the poet's writings. The paper concludes with a list of collection strengths and desired materials for further collection development.</ab>

        <ab>The study will evaluate the accessibility standards of local North Carolina newspaper companion websites when compared against larger national newspaper websites' accessibility implementation. A sample of 10 news sites selected from a list of all North Carolina newspaper companion websites will be evaluated against 10 National News Sites. The selected sites will be tested using WebAIM's WAVE accessibility evaluator to determine whether the sites adhere to standards established by section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The results will provide new insights into the accessibility and usability of the companion sites of North Carolina newspapers for persons with disabilities when compared to the top newspapers in the country. This study will fill a gap in the literature on the topic and be of interest to web developers, persons with disabilities and the general public of North Carolina.</ab>

These units are devoted to documenting some aspect of the American South in one form or another. After analyzing the current relationship of these three units, the study tested the ability of the three units to work collaborative in collection development. This study will offer a framework of needs for effective future collaboration in collection development on UNC-CH's campus and on other campuses.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reviews materials from Fall 2013 courses and others at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill to assess (a) how students' privacy interests were affected by instructors' choice of electronic resources and (b) the extent to which instructors utilized university libraries as a means through which to access resources. Instructors choose resources and means of access that compromise students' privacy interests; students are directed to access third party websites, thereby agreeing to these websites' privacy policies and terms of service, which results in these websites inserting dataveillance mechanisms into students' computers' and continuously harvesting their personal information Nor do instructors seem to utilize University Libraries as a resource to the greatest extent possible, thus impeding University Libraries' ability to assess value.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines children's picture books and the characteristics of social roles presented to young children through the stories in picture books published between 1970 and 2005. Between the ages of eighteen months and three years, children begin to develop their personal identity. This is primarily through observation of prominent figures in the child's life, as well as observations though through stories told to them in the oral tradition. The vast number of picture books available to parents, librarians, and teachers makes it even more daunting when working to select the proper material to present to a child. Twenty-seven picture books were analyzed according to a coding schema to determine how they presented the characters' social role, and by extension, their gender roles. Categories for coding included traditional stereotyping of both male and female characters.</ab>

        <ab>This study follows an examination 26 film adaptations of Young Adult novels, conducted to determine a correlation between the amount of story changes occurring from the original book to the film and the measure of financial and critical success the film receives. Over the past fourteen years, the market for film adaptations of popular young adult novels has exploded. Fans are often disappointed, however, as the films frequently make numerous changes to the original story. Three main categories of change emerge: changes in characterization, changes in plot, and changes in content censorship. The success of these changes varies, depending on how they are used. Many changes are not motivated by story enhancement at all, but by personal, industry, or cinematic advantages. The study shows that there is no correlation between amount of changes and financial or critical success, though there is a link between book popularity and film revenue.</ab>

        <ab>Since the advent of the Internet, the concept of the "Digital Divide," has been at the forefront of governmental policy discussions. The current president and his administration have made huge strides in working to help Americans gain access to broadband services. However, the issues of connecting Americans to high-speed Internet go further than the expansion of broadband infrastructure. With the introduction of the smartphone to the global market, the ways in which we interact with information have changed drastically. This study seeks to determine whether currently available information services are affordable to the population at large.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years, athletic shoe brands have increased production and sales of retro sneakers. Retro sneakers consist of popular styles from the 80s and 90s that are highly valued today, in 2013 (Void, 2013). With a dedicated customer market eager to purchase newly released retro sneakers, retailers often sell out of styles in minutes thus quickly creating a secondary market. This study gathers and analyzes completed sales data from the biggest secondary sneaker market, eBay. The findings of this study help to explain why the retro sneaker market is so popular and suggests that selling large shoe sizes, at a fixed price, close to a sneaker's release date will maximize seller revenue. The article's author has been an avid sneaker connoisseur for many years, and during this time, has completed hundreds of eBay transactions. To complete the study, the author leverages a combination of observed market behaviors and critical thinking.</ab>

        <ab>This paper explores the relationship between social science journal data sharing policies and online data availability. The study was conducted to understand the effectiveness of data sharing policies on influencing researchers to share their data. Data availability for 65 articles published in social science journals with three types of data sharing policies (mandatory, recommended, or no policy) were examined. The study also examined the type and location of the data. A low percentage of researchers were found to share their original research data and the majority who shared their data were bound by a mandatory data replication policy. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between strong data sharing policies and the rate of data sharing. Journals can use these findings to inform decisions on maintaining, expanding, or enforcing policies.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study is to analyze collection development policies in public libraries in North Carolina in order to illuminate the current status of these policies in the state. Methods included a documentation review and content analysis of the collection development policies of public libraries in North Carolina. The policies were checked against a list of aspects recommended in the literature. Results indicate that the current state of the policies reflects the complaint from policy opponents that these types of policies are often not written well enough to be maintained and useful in practice by librarians. There is not an existing standard with minimum guidelines in place for constructing these policies.</ab>

Therefore, many would say that creating a native application is the way to reach the largest number of users in the given mobile device market. The purpose of this study is to confirm that even though, for some information needs, a native application is the best option; information needs do exist to create necessity for mobile web applications. To show this, I have created, implemented and analyzed a survey to ask respondents about their mobile device usage. The study will serve to show that not only are native applications necessary in the future, but mobile web applications also play a vital role in the future of mobile device usage.</ab>

The demand for findability in metadata management is growing in response to the growth in scale of DFC data grid. HIVE project is being integrated into iRODS, in DFC data grid to provide a service to take advantage of open vocabularies. This paper reports on the iRODS/HIVE integration. First, the architecture and core components of iRODS/HIVE integration are discussed. Next, this paper reports on the process of installing iRODS/HIVE demo on local machine for HIVE user. The future work for iRODS/HIVE integration will be integrating automatic keywords extraction (KEA++ and MAUI) to support term suggestion, and providing rating feature for the suggested terms.</ab>

        <ab>This study focuses on the usage of Facebook as a user service by academic libraries. The purpose of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the use of Facebook among academic libraries. A content analysis was conducted on a sample of 75 Facebook pages managed by academic libraries selected from Association of Research Libraries (ARL)'s 2012 list of the top 100 libraries in the United States. This study examines academic library Facebook pages in order to explore to what extent Facebook pages have been implemented by academic libraries, what type of information are shared on libraries' Facebook pages, and how successful these pages are in reaching out to users. Results of this study provide not only data to illustrate to what extent Facebook has been adopted and how it is being used, but also provide useful implications and suggestions of future use of Facebook pages.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the relationship between funding and service levels in public library systems in North Carolina. It uses data collected from the State Library (fiscal years 2008-2009 to 2012-2013) and interviews conducted with administrators of public library systems in the state to make observations about the current funding situation. This research is designed to provide up-to-date information on the funding situation and on administrators' thought processes regarding that situation in order to better inform practice by other library administrators.</ab>

        <ab>Massive Open Online Classes (MOOCs) have stormed the online education landscape over the past five years and show no sign of disappearing. Though studies have been done about the characteristics of online or distance education students, the characteristics of MOOC students are less known to researchers beyond demographics and participation statistics. Likewise, the implications of MOOC's for librarians who will need to support this new community of are widely unknown. A survey of learning preferences, motivations, and resource needs and uses of MOOC students in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Metadata MOOC in Fall 2013 determined that, though learning preferences exist, participants enrolled in this course were predominantly Independent and Participant with similar needs across learning styles despite different learning preferences. Participants are also motivated by professional interest and intellectual curiosity and would welcome additional materials in order to further explore MOOC topics.</ab>

        <ab>This study used content analysis to examine eight juvenile fiction novels about bullying. The purpose of this study was to examine how bullying and the role(s) teachers and administrators play in those bullying situations are portrayed in the literature available to students. Specifically, this paper focused on if and how teachers and administrators dealt with the bullying after it happened, and if they were proactive in addressing and talking about bullying before it happened. The selected novels were analyzed in depth using a checklist developed from reviewing the criteria outlined in the literature to identify the roles the teachers and administrators play in bullying. Also, the novels were examined, compared and discussed through the lens of the trends that emerged from a full read of each novel. Overall, the novels analyzed for this study showed very little to no teacher or administrator involvement in the bullying situations presented in the books.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigates how the query suggestions of two commercial Web search engines change over time. The study was based on manually collected query suggestion data for 50 seed queries from Google and Bing in a two-week period. Several measures were used to analyze data which were basic statistics, change rate, change patterns, change frequency, and patterns of query reformulations. Results indicated the query suggestions of commercial Web search engines changed regularly. The circles of change is determined by the search engines themselves. Moreover, in terms of patterns of query reformulation, query suggestions provided a large amount of specialized queries. The results also revealed that the most common change patterns of query suggestion lists were order change and query substitution.</ab>

        <ab>This study is a content analysis examining websites of special collection libraries and archives supporting large-scale digitization initiatives to determine the kinds of information a functionalities available to online users. Large-scale digitization is characterized by aggregate-level selection and metadata of materials to be digitized. The analysis was conducted on a group often institutions identified as participating in large-scale digitization. The results demonstrate success in highlighting digitized materials on the website, but show a lack of consistency in the use of item-level and aggregate-level metadata, suggesting inconsistency in the definition of large-scale digitization.</ab>

        <ab>Librarians and graduate assistants at R.B. House Undergraduate Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill teach information literacy instruction sessions to students in the required freshman English courses. One-shot or multi-shot instruction sessions are typically taught but experimenting with instructional methods/techniques is encouraged. Flipped classroom, or inverted classroom, instruction has become increasingly popular at the university. The goal of this study is to explore the effectiveness of traditional versus flipped class instruction to see if one method is more effective for helping students develop information literacy skills. Approximately 50 students participated in the study. Students' unit projects were scored using an information literacy rubric as the tool for assessment. Overall, students' scores in the flipped classes were higher than students' scores in the traditional classes.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a survey to users of the Internet Archive's Archive-It Web-archiving tool, aiming to examine the descriptive metadata practice of archivists of the Web, how Web archives are accessed, and what variables facilitate or impede metadata implementation in Web collections. Whereas books often contain contextual information bound between their covers, archival materials require additional explanation of context. The Web is the most transient of electronic records, and although it is currently being preserved at a higher rate than ever before, treatment of Web collections is still not up to archival standards. Through better understanding of current Web archiving metadata practices, this study hopes to help lay groundwork for future best practices.</ab>

        <ab>This content analysis of six fantasy novels for children aged approximately 8 to 12 discusses the archetypal Hero's Journey and its relation to the gender of the protagonist. These novels were read and analyzed for adherence to or departure from the traditional 17 stages of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, described in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The focus of the content analysis is whether female protagonists on quests face modified quests and employ stereotypically feminine techniques to overcome obstacles as opposed to their swashbuckling male counterparts. The modifications found in the six novels suggest that heroines rely on empathy rather than strength to complete quests.</ab>

        <ab>As documents of complicated socio-cultural standing, women's diaries frustrate traditional approaches to archival description and speak to the subjective nature of the practice. This exploratory study traces the scholarly life of the Southern Historical Collection's Sarah Lois Wadley diary in relation to its finding aid and to significant events in its archival existence. It follows the citation of 197 of the diary's dated entries across 37 historical books and statistically analyzes the usage of described entries versus the usage of non-described entries in order to explore the connection between archival description and scholarly interpretation. In addition to arriving at correlations that demonstrate digitization and encoding's positive effect on access, the study discusses the intersection between historical and archival judgment and also the potential for descriptive practices to embrace collaboration.</ab>

        <ab>Recent statistics indicate that many minority populations are not being well served by our educational system. Multicultural literature in school libraries can have a role in reversing this trend, through literature's role as counter-storytelling. This study examines the library collection of public middle schools in Fairfax County, Virginia for the number of African American and Hispanic fiction titles relative to the entire fiction collection and how many ALA award titles each school holds compared to their ethnic population. All had some titles regardless of ethnic population and showed a trend toward more titles with a higher ethnic population. However, percent titles held was very low relative to percent population. Total ethnic award titles collected were also low indicating an underused resource.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores librarians' perceptions of the presence, absence, and importance of regional identity building activities in public libraries in rural Central Appalachia through the results of a survey distributed to and interviews conducted with library directors who serve these areas. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data suggests many libraries are promoting regional identity building through programming, collection development, and outreach and that a majority would be interested in complementing their current offerings with Appalachian-focused services if barriers such as lack of funds and limited staff availability were mitigated. Further research might focus on creating a set of best practices and a resource list for designing region-specific library services and determining library patrons' perceptions of these offerings as a component of library services. This study also addresses gaps in the library literature on rural public libraries in Appalachia and the role of libraries in promoting regional identity in their communities.</ab>

        <ab>Physicians frequently need clinical reference material at the time they are taking care of patients, but despite the widespread availability of seemingly appropriate resources, physicians do not consistently avail themselves. Previous research has shown that the main obstacle to resource use is lack of time to search, followed by inability to find the information even with extended searching. Using a randomly selected sample of previously published questions (Clinical Questions Collection at the National Library of Medicine), current online electronic clinical reference resources were searched. Search times, success rates, and result quality were compared. Retrieval of drug information was dominated by navigation time, whereas searches for other materials were dominated by search time. It was rare that actually reading the material required significant time. Based on the results, an improved interface for accessing clinical reference data is proposed. Key features include a "Fast" interface that minimizes navigation time to easily found resources and a "Flex" interface that minimizes search time for more arcane material.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigates how the web usability and design preferences differ under different cultural contexts by examining two multilingual websites in China and the United States, i.e., Air China and MSN. The study was performed in three phases: a usability test was carried out to evaluate the performance of two localized versions upon the same user's request, and then post-test questionnaires was given out to identify user's perceptions on five main types of cultural markers, and lastly a semi-structured interview was conducted to explore user's opinion about the impact of cultural dimensions on the web design and usability. The findings indicate that cultural factors play a significant role in the way users approach their interaction with multilingual websites. And the comparison and analysis procedure can also be adapted for other websites under other cultural contexts.</ab>

        <ab>This study used content analysis to examine works of literature that depict characters with multiple sclerosis in adult fiction. The purpose of this study was to examine how characters with multiple sclerosis are portrayed and viewed in literature that is available for adults. Specifically, this paper investigated what novels are available to readers, whether or not multiple sclerosis is described with medical accuracy and candidness while still treating these characters in a dignified manner, and how these characters respond to and cope with their diagnosis as well as how other characters in the novels react to this disease. Out of over forty relevant titles found, only the twenty-five novels most readily available in libraries were chosen and read, and fifteen of those analyzed. Overall, the books were found to be surprisingly diversified in genre, characterization, and writing style, and to be medically accurate.</ab>

        <ab>Digital forensics methods and tools have many useful applications in the curation of digital materials in libraries, archives and museums (LAMs). Recent research efforts have shown that open source digital forensics tools can help LAM professionals to extract digital contents from born-digital media and make more informed preservation decisions. Most of these tools have ways to display the metadata of the digital media, but few provide file-level access without having to mount the device or download the files. This paper describes a project to develop a tool that supports access to the contents of digital media without having to mount or download the entire image. The work examines two approaches in creating this tool: First, a graphical user interface, running on a local machine. Second, a version in which the tool is deployed as a web-based application. The project incorporates off-the-shelf, open source forensics tools and libraries including The Sleuth Kit and libewf along with Python scripts and Flask[10] templates to generate HTML content for browsing media images.</ab>

The interviews reveal that the organizations are looking for ways to increase access to and public awareness of their collections. The organizations also expressed interest in using technology to digitize materials and provide digital access to materials and catalogs.</ab>

        <ab>Cultural institutions like museums, libraries and archives are and have been experiencing low numbers in usage and visitation among minority populations. The number of minorities taking advantage of services provided by these institutions has become significantly important due to recent growth in minority populations. This new growth rate has surpassed that of the Non- Hispanic Caucasian population, the traditional audience base for cultural institutions. Efforts made in the past couple of decades to encourage minorities to pursue careers in museums, libraries and archives have not been as productive as hoped. One solution to this issue may be found in new technologies that have emerged in the new millennium. If cultural institutions were to take advantage of some of the marketing techniques using social media, this may just give them the tools they need to attract and encourage higher participation from America's minority population.</ab>

This study looks at another area of tagging, specifically what the users themselves think, by using content analysis of a message board thread on the topic of moderation in a particular social tagging system. The findings indicate that, like the scholars and individuals overseeing social tagging projects, their views are fairly mixed. Some want a system with strong moderation to weed out malicious users and fix mistakes. Others don't trust moderators not to serve their own ends, and want a more open and creative system that they ultimately see as more honest. The challenge for future social tagging system moderators is to please both groups without alienating either.</ab>

        <ab>Older adults have been demonstrated to exhibit special needs with regards to web interface design. Technological experience and aging-associated cognitive and physical changes can all contribute to decreased system usability by older adults, particularly with regard to browsing and navigation. Thus, websites that serve older adults in addition to other populations should be designed with an emphasis on older adults' navigational needs in addition to their informational needs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the information-seeking behaviors and information needs of a health information website's primary target audiences, university researchers and community-dwelling older adults, and determine whether the current website design supported those behaviors and needs. Data about these user groups' information behaviors was gathered via focus groups and individual interviews and qualitatively analyzed. The results of this assessment were used to develop initial recommendations for website redesign.</ab>

        <ab>As America's racial diversity includes an increasing number of multiracial families and children, it's imperative that diverse resources accurately showcase these families to help children discuss their racial identities. This study uses content analysis to explore how interracial families are portrayed in children's books and how these books address the subject of race. It discusses how the family representations match current population statistics and are affected by authors'/illustrators' racial identities. The research uses guidelines for identifying racism published by the Council on Interracial Books for Children and Rudine Sims Bishop's categories of cultural treatment to compare trends and locate deficiencies. This research identifies areas of improvement needed in regard to the number and types of multiracial children's books created, particularly for Hispanic (Latino) and Asian mixed race populations. It also helps parents, educators, librarians, and child care providers identify quality resources to guide children in multiracial self-identification.</ab>

        <ab>In the face of economic pressures and educational policy challenges, law schools nationwide have begun to shift away from doctrinal teaching toward practice-oriented instruction. Legal research instruction is also in flux, with research instructors and law librarians attempting to prepare students for real-world research. Law school clinics offer unique opportunities for law librarians to support students as they engage in real-world legal research. To explore the legal research skills required by clinical work as well as the research support and instruction students currently receive, interviews were conducted with 14 clinicians. The goal of this study is two-fold. First, to identify those skills and resources on which librarians can focus during instruction. Second, clinicians were asked to describe the support, if any, that the clinic or clinic students received from librarians in hopes of facilitating discussion between librarians and clinics as they work together to better serve students through formalized relationships.</ab>

        <ab>A survey of non-academic archival repositories revealed that a majority of respondents are using digital asset management systems (DAMS) to manage digitized material. However, considering the barriers to DAMS use and the complexity of managing digitized content, DAMS is not a comprehensive solution for managing records, nor is there a clear replacement for DAMS. Lack of institutional support is identified as a main impediment to digital asset management and DAMS implementation, pointing to the importance of advocacy for digital asset management.</ab>

The extensive open planning process, public input, and early success of the project has many implications for public libraries, and new models of service in digital spaces. I also briefly consider the implications of startups, and how a public testing model can be adapted for use within public libraries. Through preliminary analysis of the DPLA, the private sector, and current public library projects, strategies are identified that can be applied widely across the profession.</ab>

New visual programming environments have been created to break down those programming barriers. This project looks at the way applications can be built by a novice or non-programmer and evaluates App Inventor, a visual programming environment designed to create Android applications without knowing Java. This paper describes all phases of the project, from the selection process for choosing a program, to the testing and evaluation of the final mobile application.</ab>

        <ab>This report surveys a successful attempt to build a HGIS (historical geographic information system) of liturgical processional routes in the city of Constantinople (modem day Istanbul) during the 9th and 10th centuries. Data about the routes was gathered from the Typikon of the Great Church, a medieval book describing the liturgical ceremonies of the Hagia Sophia, the largest and most important church in Constantinople during the Byzantine era. Information about the different churches mentioned in the Typikon was gathered from a variety of sources, most notably from Raymond Janin's multivolume series on the subject. Major problems during the construction of the HGIS were finding accurate information on churches that no longer exist, constructing a map of an area which is dramatically different today topologically and the lack of English language sources. Despite these problems, the resulting HGIS allows for a clearer view of how processional routes moved across the city.</ab>

        <ab>Keona Health, a spin-off company from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and in partnership with the National Institute of Health, has developed a triage platform called Online Triage. UNC Chapel Hill's Campus Health Services piloted the Keona platform by offering it to over 28,000 students. The pilot demonstrated significant nurse time savings, improved patient safety, and increased nurse satisfaction. Students used Online Triage from home using a link on the university website, as well as from kiosks in Health Services facilities. We tracked data on several variables including nurse review time and concordance between the nurse and our Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. A total of 93% of students said they would use Online Triage to save time, but also to get reassurance and save money. Additionally, 77% of patients said they were moderately, very, or extremely likely to use it next time they had a health problem. Compared to traditional triage using Online Triage resulted in a 31% reduction in nurse time. The CDS system was able to safely screen patients for potential emergencies, and improve safety over patient's pre-dispositions. Nurses also reported a high degree of satisfaction with Online Triage and valued how it prepared them for patient interactions and reduced their documentation time. More work needs to be done improving the questionnaires, emergency screening, and display of information to nurses.</ab>

        <ab>Recently there has been a steady increase in the number of non-white students, especially Latino students in southeast school systems. This study determines whether this population is being successfully supported in their school library by asking two questions: (1) Are culturally relevant resources that are based on award winning nominations available to the Latino population within each school library? (2) What facilitators and barriers exist for the School Librarians supporting this population? This study analyzed the prevalence of Latino book award titles in three southeast school libraries, and conducted interviews with their school librarians. Data collected was based on a list of book titles that have received one of the three awards: the Pura Belpr√©, Americas, or Tom√°s Rivera award. Then, a content analysis was conducted from the responses of three phone interviews, which revealed the facilitators and barriers they encountered to support this population.</ab>

        <ab>This paper focuses on discussing the possibility of applying big financial data to a NoSQL database. The study explains the rationale for using NoSQL to solve problems arising in financial data and the advantages of a NoSQL database over RDBMS. Then the research further examines the features of major database types, and analyzes whether a database is appropriate for the storage and management of detailed financial data. Finally, a simple test of querying stock data was designed to demonstrate how the performance of Cassandra can be evaluated.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a survey of teens in Girl Scout, Boy Scout and Teen Advisory Board groups in Orange County, North Carolina. The study was conducted to determine key trends in teen library usage. Forty usable surveys were collected from three troops and one teen advisory board. The study found that all teens surveyed held library cards, most from a young age. While a review of the literature suggests a need for elaborate programming, teen participants used the library primarily to check out books or to read. Demographic factors in Orange County, NC, may account for these differences.</ab>

        <ab>Several bibliometric studies of the human health sciences literature have been published, but there have been few attempts to quantify the research published in the veterinary medical literature. The purpose of this bibliometric analysis was to detect patterns in articles published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine over a 15-year period, and thereby provide an assessment of the research available to clinicians in the specialty of veterinary internal medicine. Articles from four select years over the period of study were classified according to authorship, species investigated, purpose of study and study design. The results of this study provide a base for future bibliometric analysis of the veterinary literature and an appraisal of the articles published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine for the editors of that journal and those with an interest in veterinary internal medicine.</ab>

        <ab>The Metadata Standards Directory Working Group that is part of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) is charged with creating a directory of metadata standards. The Digital Curation Centre's (DCC) Disciplinary Metadata Catalogue was selected as a starting point for this effort. A form was created to gather information on eleven aspects of metadata standards, and distributed via email across several interest groups in order to collect information on metadata standards. The thirty-two responses were evaluated; new and supplemental information was extracted and formatted for uploading onto the DCC's Web page. This resulted in the addition of eleven new standards, ten new extensions, twelve new tools, and twenty-three new use cases. This paper reports the results of this information gathering activity, including a display of the range of metadata standards, extensions, tools, and disciplines received in the responses. Suggestions for the next steps toward an open and collaborative directory are also included.</ab>

Earlier studies (Kornejeva, 2012; Liao et al., 2013) indicate that visual components of blogs can impact readers' experiences with blog content. This study aims to further explore the ways in which visual components impact readers. The number of images, sizes of the images, number of comments and number of non-comment interactions per post were collected from 400 WordPress posts and 400 Blogger posts. While no effect of image size was detected, an effect of image presence was detected. Opportunities for further research were discussed, as were the implications of the findings of this study.</ab>

The tags were programmed using an app on an NFC enabled device and were each labeled with that they were programmed to do. A pre-survey and post-survey were used as forms of assessment to determine user familiarity with the technology and how the tags were used, respectively.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes an electronic questionnaire survey of reference archivists who are members of the Reference, Access, and Outreach Section of the Society of American Archivists. The purpose of this study was to investigate the education and training received by archivists in reference services and the extent to which they are prepared for their work. Although the majority of respondents attended a higher education program in library science or archival studies with a reference course as a degree requirement, very few had the option or possibility of taking a class specific to archival reference. Most respondents cited work experience and on-the-job training as the effective means of learning to do reference in archival institutions. However, many respondents also noted that aspects of their general reference course were transferable to archival reference. Further studies should be conducted to examine the efficacy of archival-centered reference courses.</ab>

        <ab>Library literature related to makerspaces often concentrates on makerspaces within public and school libraries. This study seeks to fill the gap in the existing literature by focusing on role of makerspaces in academic libraries. This study describes a questionnaire survey of academic library makerspaces across the United States. The survey was conducted to determine how makerspaces complement the missions of their host library, how academic libraries utilize makerspaces as pedagogical tools, and why academic libraries serve as good locations for makerspaces. Librarians from twelve academic library makerspaces responded to the survey. The democratization of technology, the maintenance of the library's perception as a leader in technology innovation, and the need to support scholarship are the most cited reasons for including a makerspace in an academic library of the libraries surveyed. The survey also revealed that workshops and personal consultations are the most popular type of makerspace instruction.</ab>

        <ab>Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a popular information technology (IT) process standard that has been adopted across private and public sectors with literature detailing a variety of critical success factors. This exploratory study examined the implementation of ITIL-informed processes for IT change management within the State of North Carolina in terms of what step-by-step processes result from ITIL implementation in the context of critical success factors. ITIL implementation is shown to create more complex processes within the state, and the key critical success factor reported is shown to be ITIL training and the communication it facilitates. Practical implications of the findings for professionals are discussed and visual diagrams display the change management processes outlined.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a study done of the relationship between library-provided faculty research services and faculty productivity at American Bar Association accredited law schools. The study consisted of a survey of law school librarians of faculty usage of faculty research services and the gathering of publicly available information for lists of published law journal articles, U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings, and faculty size. Ultimately, 54 law schools were included in the study. Faculty productivity, both unweighted and weighted by prestige, was compared with the frequency and percentage of faculty using faculty research services, U.S. News &amp; World Report law school rankings, and faculty size. The top two correlations on faculty productivity were U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings and faculty size, followed by either frequency of faculty use or percentage of faculty use depending on whether productivity was weighted or unweighted.</ab>

        <ab>Controlled vocabularies facilitate interoperability but present challenges related to cost, usability, and interdisciplinarity. The Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering ' (HIVE) project aims to meet some of these challenges by providing an approach for integrating multiple controlled vocabularies. A companion effort to the ongoing development of HIVE, this research study developed and implemented a Web survey targeting many roles associated with data repositories -- data contributors, data curators, DataNet administrators, and repository developers -- regarding their uses of controlled vocabularies. Results indicate that a long tail of controlled vocabularies is currently in use by data repositories. Although the convenience sample of this study cannot be generalized to the broader population of data repository stakeholders, the results of this study indicate that a future study could reasonably hypothesize that demand for HIVE-like services exists among data contributors, data curators, and repository developers.</ab>

        <ab>Instructional services play a central and growing role in academic libraries' offerings. As these services continue to evolve, librarians are increasingly called upon to not only plan and deliver instruction, but also to assess their efforts. This study sought to evaluate library instruction through an electronic survey of English 105 and English 105i course instructors within the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Writing Program. Survey questions were designed to examine both the attitudes and behaviors of respondents, with the goal of gaining an understanding of factors involved in instructors' decisions to include library-led instruction sessions in their courses, their expectations of this instruction, and their motivation for future use. Individual responses are highlighted, as are potential associations observed among length of teaching experience, course objectives, assignment development practices and perceptions of library instructors. Implementations for both practice and further research are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This study is a content analysis often historical fiction novels set in Tudor England featuring female protagonists. Five of the novels analyzed were published in the 1960s and five were published in the 2000s so that a comparison could be done of whether the characterization of female characters in this genre has changed over time. The books were assessed for the presence of traditional stereotypical female characteristics as well as for the portrayals of romantic relationships, women's sexuality, and women's agency. The results of the analysis show that there has been little change in the portrayal of these female characters over time.</ab>

Findings indicate that disk images and forensic reports can be generated quickly, often within seconds, for media of small storage sizes, such as floppy disks. However, for media with large amounts of storage, such as an external hard drive, a single task (generating a disk image) can take several days to complete.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines copyright concerns of syndicated materials within digital copies of college student newspapers. A sample of 100 colleges were inspected to determine if archived issues of the student newspapers were available online and if so, did the newspapers contain syndicated material. The collection was further examined to establish if any effort was made to exclude the copyrighted material or if an explanation was provided for the inclusion of the material. This study shows approximately one third of the student newspapers that are available online contain syndicated material and only twenty percent made an effort to reduce copyright infringement or document fair use. Considering these findings and the prevalence of digitizing college student newspapers, more research is needed in this field.</ab>

        <ab>This study attempts to address future collection development priorities of the Music Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through recent-past circulation patterns by examining circulation statistics for the past twenty years, as well as interlibrary loan statistics for the past nine years, to determine which subsections of the library are overused or underused compared to the library's baseline circulation. Subsections studied included LC subclasses of books and scores, book and score size, Dewey vs. LC scores, books stored offsite, and book language. Results suggest that the music library has an acceptable circulation rate for both books and scores, though the library might consider collecting more of the following to more closely align with patron use and demand: secular vocal music scores, French- and Spanish-language books, and books about jazz and popular music.</ab>

The primary research questions are: 1) What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of mobile devices with different screen sizes for scholarly reading? 2) Is screen size a major factor affecting usability? The author conducted a qualitative and quantitative methods study, including observation, questionnaire and semi-structured interview. The study found the screen size of mobile devices is a major factor that impacts usability when it is smaller than a certain scale. No significant difference was found between full-size 9.7-inch tablet and 7.9-inch mini-tablet in terms of ease of navigation, reading speed, reading effectiveness and overall experience. The 4-inch phone is the least desirable device for scholarly reading, and has the lower performance of the presentation of texts and figures. Other possible factors include the device weight, portability and physical design.</ab>

        <ab>Concepts and practices of community archiving continue to gain traction within the archival profession. In 2013 alone, the introduction of Terry Cook's community archives paradigm, the number of published case studies, and the amount of sessions and presentations at the Society of American Archivists' Archives 2013 Conference demonstrated that archivists work outside of their institutions and collections to assist smaller organizations care for their records. However, even as Cook advocates for community archives, and these case studies provide the best picture of community archiving in practice, it remains a specialized and narrow picture of how archivists work to educate and help organize records within non-archival organizations. This exploratory study utilizes a mixed methods approach in an attempt to recognize the educational opportunities and determine who else in the profession performs community archiving, and argues for continued engagement with community archiving practices.</ab>

        <ab>Despite increasing efforts to engage girls in STEM, a STEM gender gap still exists. One possible reason for this is the persistent masculine/unattractive stereotype of women engaged in STEM fields. This study examined twelve young adult novels featuring female protagonists who display STEM interests in an effort to determine how the protagonists are portrayed as both STEM actors and teenage girls. The results showed that the protagonists were mostly represented as well-supported, well-rounded, and successful at meeting their STEM goals. They were, however, shown to possess more masculine traits than feminine traits. The books studied were ultimately recommended for use as a tool to interest adolescent girls in engaging with STEM fields.</ab>

        <ab>Legacy data stores of experimental assay data in a pharmaceutical R&amp;D organization are poorly structured and annotated, which hinders the integration of these data with data from more recent research programs and from other publicly available clinical, biological and chemical data sources. Being able to integrate and analyze this data in aggregate will help maximize the value of the available data, which will help inform and potentially improve the drug discovery process. In this study, text mining and information extraction tools and techniques were applied to improve the annotation of a subset of these data in an accurate and automated fashion. Experimental results of this study show promise for classifying some features of the available assay data. Initial results of classification using a Na√Øve-Bayes classifier provided high values of accuracy (up to 93%). This indicates that the methods described in this study can be extended to larger dataset to extract more annotation from the available data.</ab>

        <ab>The role of paraprofessionals in public libraries is in flux, and is a source of debate among library and information professionals. The present study offers empirical illumination to this discussion by employing a web-based questionnaire survey inquiring into the relationship between job responsibility and turnover rate for paraprofessional positions. While this study was exploratory in nature, analysis of the results uncovered evidence for a negative correlation between the turnover rate for a given paraprofessional position and that position's level of resemblance to MLS-requiring positions. Implications of this finding and limitations of the survey are discussed, and avenues for future research are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Large scale digitization initiatives at archival institutions utilize different descriptive methodologies based on the format of material being digitized, the availability of resources, and the descriptive philosophy of the archivists leading each project. This paper gives the results of a study involving in-depth interviews with eight archivists leading and participating in large scale digitization initiatives for manuscript materials. The findings provide information on the current state of description utilized in the field of large-scale manuscript digitization, including the archivists' perceptions of the effect of their project's description on resource discoverability. The findings of this study can be used by archivists developing large scale digitization projects to determine the descriptive methodology that would be most effective for their project and user community.</ab>

        <ab>Although much has been written on the efforts of the State Library of North Carolina and other organizations to deliver library services to citizens living in rural areas, little has been written about the availability of library services in northwestern North Carolina. In this exploratory study, some factors affecting the development of library services in Watauga County are considered. Information gleaned from State Library publications, the local newspaper, works about the Extension Service and the Citizens' Library Movement, and other historical sources documenting library services in Watauga County not only adds to the scant body of knowledge about the evolution of library development in this county but, more importantly, enriches our understanding of community life in the region during the first half of the twentieth century. Thus, a richer understanding of a community's history is the happy consequence of researching the history of its library.</ab>

        <ab>This paper documents a minimal-investment project to migrate legacy exhibits of the State Archives of North Carolina and the State Library of North Carolina into a new exhibiting platform. The Drupal-based platform links with the institutions' existing discovery platform (CONTENTdm) and offers robust means for centrally managing and creating exhibits. Through discussion of this project and the surrounding literature, the paper argues that digital exhibits remain a vital and sustainable tool for libraries and archives, helping institutions to fulfill their role not only as data disseminators, but as active agents of mediation and interpretation. The paper provides specific documentation of tools used in the project, detailed time logs, and project cost assessments.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: With the increasing popularity of graphic novels, the medium poses new problems to information professionals, particularly in how to organize this material in conjunction with more traditional literature. This study attempted to understand the classification of graphic novels in three collections in order to compare their organizational systems to current trends in the literature. Methods: The study collected data on the type of classification system implemented (cataloging, shelving, or metadata schema), the system's effectiveness within its environment, and employee opinions on implementation. Unlike previous studies, commercial collections were also observed for comparison. Results: This study synthesized scattered information about the implementation of classification systems and revealed while authors have suggested best practices for providing access to graphic novels, these practices were not yet used in the libraries studied There was no clear universal classification system, either in the settings studied or the literature. Conclusions: Flexibility, transparency, and consistency should be the driving forces for graphic novel classification rather than a single, rigid system. Libraries should balance their methods with the needs of the patrons and utilize resources outside of the classification system to increase access to materials.</ab>

        <ab>This study utilized latent content analysis to determine the characteristics of villains in fantasy novels written for children, young adults, and adults. Additionally, the study sought to identify the differences in complexity of villains in these books by analyzing the ways in which the villains were described and the ways in which they interacted with the world around them. Twelve books were selected, four from each age range, from among the most popular current fantasy novels. This study discovered that the complexity of the villains increased with each step up in age range. The villains characteristics also became more balanced between internally and externally defined traits.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines users' choice of navigation or search to locate documents on their personal computer and the effects of elicitation method on the retrieval process. Nineteen students from UNC Chapel Hill were prompted to find documents created between 1.5 and 4 months ago with three prompts: the first page of the document, the file name, and the participant's description of an item. Analysis found the majority of participants used navigation for retrieval and there were effects from the different elicitation methods. The first page of the document prompt resulted in the longest and most difficult retrievals; the file name prompt resulted in quicker and easier retrievals and the most use of search; and the description prompt resulted in the easiest and nearly the quickest retrievals. Implications from this study are that file location memory may be primed by description and that users may not use search effectively for re-finding files.</ab>

        <ab>This project creates a professionally printed and bound book to collect youth-created texts and images from public library programs in a long-standing African-American community with high levels of poverty and crime. The project was conducted to empower the numerous voices of the young people of a struggling community library by drawing on community strengths in an area most often defined by its weaknesses. Two cameras were loaned to McDougald Terrace Branch Library in Durham, North Carolina, and texts and photographs created during the daily programming were collected. These texts included highly personal poems and descriptions of self and community. The final book was professionally printed in color and paperback bound, and two copies of the final book were given to the public library collection. McDougald Terrace library closed in October 2013 and the book remains a patron-created document of its final months. Final written reflections consider future directions of the project to other libraries and agreement on project success by McDougald Terrace's librarian.</ab>

        <ab>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library has used Libraryh31p as its chat reference platform for approximately six years. In that time, the placement of chat widgets has expanded to include library web pages, Articles+, the catalog, and Serials Solutions pages. One important location remained to explore: placement of a chat widget in library-licensed databases. If a user is in a database, they would currently need to open a new browser tab and navigate back to the library's Contact Us page to initiate a chat. In an effort to meet users closer to their point of need, a widget was embedded in UNC's databases licensed from EBSCOhost. After a trial period, the resulting chat logs and transcripts were analyzed. By embedding the widget in databases, where a good portion of research is performed, the number and overall proportion of research-related chat questions increased.</ab>

        <ab>Oral history formally emerged as a field of study in 1948 and continues to expand through the present. Oral histories are primary sources with a focus on audio recordings of interviews, and many archives hold and provide public access to oral history collections. Because they present unique characteristics as archival objects, archival standards do not easily apply to oral history collections, and, despite the urges of those in the field, there are no widely implemented up-to-date cataloging standards. Specifically, there is a lack in metadata content standards, leaving each collection to its own practices and procedures. The author analyzed content of existing documents to explore how archivists and librarians use metadata and archival description to describe oral history collections containing both analog and digital materials. The findings related to locally implemented metadata standards were used to develop a metadata content standard that can be applied to oral history collections broadly.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study, conducted in Spring 2013, was to evaluate the effectiveness of the undergraduate library instruction program instituted as part of the first-year English 105 course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ACRL's Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education were used to develop learning outcomes to measure students' self-efficacy in an anonymous online survey. Also measured were students' emotional responses to doing research for a paper and level of procrastination. Results indicate that all student respondents felt at least moderately confident on eight tasks, but for four of the tasks, at least one student reported having no confidence. However, the role of the library instruction program in effecting these results is inconclusive. The lack of a pre-instruction survey, in combination with poor survey response, makes it impossible to generalize the results. Nevertheless, the results can provide a baseline of comparison for future research.</ab>

        <ab>This content analysis of fourteen young adult novels examines the manner in which friendship behaviors and trends vary depending on the gender of the characters. Similarities and differences between male and female same-sex friendships in these novels were compared to determine the extent to which friendship patterns are determined by gender, and then the findings of the content analysis were compared to the trends observed in the psychology literature regarding gender and adolescent friendships. Results indicated that while psychology literature suggests many gender-based differences in friendship patterns, these differences are not actually reflected in the young adult novels being published today, which depict same-sex friendships as being largely similar in terms of the most significant trends.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes an online survey on the subject of floating collections that was sent out to members of the PUBLIB and PUBYAC listservs. The survey, which collected both quantitative and qualitative data, was conducted in order to determine how public librarians perceive the benefits and drawbacks of working with floating collections. The survey received 135 responses, 112 of which were complete. The respondents represented both adult services and children's librarians. The results indicate that while there are benefits to working with floating collections, not all libraries experience them to the same degree, and the drawbacks are significant. Problems with redistribution, collection knowledge, and the ability to serve all patrons well emerged as major difficulties. The perception put forth by the literature--that benefits are widespread and the drawbacks both temporary and easily overcome--is not supported by the results of the survey.</ab>

        <ab>With the explosion of data being moved to the cloud it is important to know the security features and risks associated with storing sensitive data in a third-parties system. The purpose of this paper is to gather information on various infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers and test them against themselves with a hypothetical test case involving data covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA data is an ideal test for data security as there are robust regulations for storage and transmission. Amazon Web Services has the best suite of services and transparency for customers of all sizes.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is an accompaniment to a Master's Project that involved creating an online database for LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer/questioning, asexual) young adult fantasy novels that enabled user-friendly Boolean searching on criteria of interest to those searching for LGBTQA YA fantasy. Database search results featured a few of the search criteria, while clicking upon a search result led users to a detailed book entry that elaborated upon the relevant metadata as appropriate. Ninety-seven LGBTQA YA fantasy novels were included in this online database. This paper includes a discussion of the motivation for the project; a description of the database design and rationale behind said design; a delineation of database scope; some analysis of LGBTQA novel metadata; and recommendations for future exploration.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the promotion of a service in one academic library. This library had lower than expected attendance in a citation management instruction class. The purpose of the study was to determine if placement of flyers in convenient locations would increase attendance at the advertised library service. Although the results of the study did not support the original expectation, from a follow-up study, it was concluded that information encountering was a useful framework for determining appropriate locations for flyer placement. Findings indicate that multiple formats of promotional materials are most effective because they increase the likelihood of exposure to the promotional message. Additionally, an understanding of user needs and motivation can help librarians devise a message that will impact the user.</ab>

        <ab>This study explored the perceptions of food bloggers on digital preservation of their blogs through an anonymous, web-based survey. It also examined if the blog format changes authenticity. Survey questions asked for data on blogging behavior, technology and preservation and deletion, editing and loss. The survey was shared through Facebook pages and groups, discussion boards and forums. Twitter and Tumblr. This study looked at how bloggers view their blogs long-term. The study assessed if bloggers view their content as possessing enduring value. Furthermore, it ascertained if the participants have taken steps to preserve their blogs. The majority of the respondents were reasonably confident in their technical skills for blog maintenance. Despite this, half were not using any strategy to save their blog. Respondents questioned the enduring value of their blogs. Some sub-group differences found between hobby bloggers and for profit bloggers. In addition, issues of authenticity were not conclusively determined.</ab>

Each librarian and archivist reported heavy usage of his or her institution's popular culture collections and that such items have varied applications across a variety of academic disciplines. Yet, while they do not all actively collect role-playing games and related ephemera for the reasons identified in this study, they agreed that role-playing games will increase in popularity as a collecting focus in university special collections.</ab>

        <ab>Informational texts have been historically underutilized in elementary classrooms. However, new Common Core Standards require an increased emphasis on informational texts across the curriculum. As leaders and instructional partners in their schools, school library media specialists (SLMSs) have a strategic opportunity to support teachers and students within this changing educational landscape. This study examined how SLMSs in elementary schools are responding to this opportunity by conducting a national survey regarding their attitudes, practices, and barriers. Media specialists held positive views regarding the new standards for Reading Informational Texts (CCSS-RIT) except its potential impact on test scores. They were highly engaged in many practices supporting student use of informational texts, though less so in promoting reading. The results may indicate that SLMSs are still adjusting to the new standards. Barriers such as fixed schedules, budget constraints, and inadequate staffing may also play a significant role in the extent of their engagement.</ab>

        <ab>This paper investigates the current practices and future plans of ethnomusicology professors in the archiving of their field recordings. Citing literature on ethnomusicologists' increasing distrust of field recordings as authentic data sources, and on the associations of field recordings archives with histories of colonialism, the study investigates whether negative associations with ethnomusicology archives correlates with a decreased likelihood of future deposits. The survey also measures ethnomusicologists' knowledge of archival practices, particularly with regard to format, digital file storage, and metadata. Findings suggest that a majority of scholars still plan to deposit their materials at an institutional archive and that these scholars anticipate academic researchers to be the primary users of their archives.</ab>

        <ab>Under the development of mobile devices, users start to use smart phones to take care of daily tasks in different situations and by variable ways. The objective of this study is to get deeper understanding of motivations, approaches, and methodologies on the usability research of mobile applications. Thirty-two recent articles are studied in the first phase literature review study and the result shows that interface elements, user interactions and usage contexts are major interface elements, and the ease of input entering is the major concern. Motivated by that, twelve UNC-CH SILS students are recruited to conduct the second-phase empirical study and the statistics indicate that handedness has obvious influence on usability. Other mobile interface design suggestions are given at the end of the study.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents an empirical study of correlating Twitter sentiments with individual stock price movements. We used an existing text-mining technique, OpinionFinder, to extract Twitter sentiment data from plaintext tweets. Different from prior researches, we explored a novel approach to aggregate Twitter sentiment features and Twitter metadata features associated with the tweets that mention a technology stock to construct a set of features, which was then correlated with the stock price movements of the respective stock prices. We thereby selected a subset of these features, which have positive correlation coefficients with the stock prices, to predict future stock price movements. The results of the prediction, however, are not as successful as expected. Although it is too early to conclude that Twitter sentiments cannot be used to predict an individual stock price, our results do provide one piece of negative evidence for such hypothesis.</ab>

After a review of the organization's existing collection development policy, a thorough review of pertinent literature was undertaken to inform practices for developing an addendum for these collections. Next, a community needs assessment was performed and similar policies for other small special and/or public libraries were reviewed. All of these steps guided the creation of a proposed collection development policy addendum submitted to the APRL at the conclusion of this project.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the factors that influence library and information science (LIS) students' views on intellectual property rights, specifically illegal reuse of content on the web. The study utilizes interviews and surveys to explore attitudes toward illegal downloading of digital content in general, extent of ethics education in LIS classes, disciplinary differences between information and library science, and these variables' influence on attitudes towards illegal reuse of copyrighted content analyzed for correlation. The end result of this study is an exploration of the attitudes about intellectual property rights in the next generation of librarians to determine future areas of improvement (e.g., required ethics trainings for future librarians and information science workers; specific ways LIS programs can emphasize intellectual property concerns).</ab>

        <ab>Research explores current professional attitudes, applications, and potential impact of linked data in archival repositories, through eight structured interviews with archivists and early adopters of linked data and semantic web practices within the archival community. Interviews evaluate current archival practitioners' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of applying linked data practices to archival description, to examine the current barriers and potential solutions in integrating linked data with archival description. Analysis investigates ways in which linked data and the semantic web may impact archival descriptive practices and user experience in accessing archival materials, and ways to facilitate greater engagement with linked data within the archival community.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study examines the concept of the "tweet session"-instances where a user of the microblogging site Twitter posts two or more related tweets in a short period of time. The study outlines a set of characteristics that aid in the detection of topically cohesive units. Four of these properties are external to the tweet text: a 24-hour time frame, inclusion of at least two tweets, inclusion of originally authored tweets and the exclusion of replies. Four additional properties were derived from the natural language processing and information retrieval literature: lexical cohesion based on unigram and character bigram feature representations, conjunction use, signals of continuation, and anaphora resolution. A sample of 220 user timelines was analyzed to detect series of tweets meeting the definition of a session as conceptualized in the study. 93.6% of timelines included at least one technical tweet session. Lexical cohesion as determined by cosine similarity retrieved the most sessions: 815 technical sessions when unigrams were used as the unit of tokenization, and 1391 technical sessions when character bigrams were used. The majority of users engaged in tweet sessions exceeding 140 characters (the Twitterimposed limit for a single tweet); however, when unigrams were used in the feature representation approximately 47% of timelines had tweet sessions of less than 140 characters on average. This research shows that tweet sessions exist and can be detected by computational means.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the efforts one health science library puts into outreach and marketing through social media platforms. It focuses specifically on a case study of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Health Science Library. There is a strong correlation between the content of social media posts and the number of patron interactions with said post. Visual content in posts boosts interactions, but creating posts with only links does not. The data gathered from the study will allow for the library to target its postings in the future, which in turn could gamer more followers and interactions with patrons.</ab>

        <ab>The Office of International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS), is the administrative office that serves international students, research scholars, and visiting professors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ISSS spent the fall 2013 - spring 2014 academic school year redesigning their website using user-centered design methodologies with the assistance of a SILS graduate student. User-centered design is an approach where the needs and requirements of the users are put in focus throughout each stage of the design process. This study describes how user-centered design principles were incorporated into the final design of the website. In addition, this study examines to see if incorporating user-centered design methodologies in the redesign of the website can allow for international students to successfully complete common tasks on the website at an above average user task completion rate of 80% or above. The study tested the task completion rate by conducting a series of user-testing sessions on the redesigned ISSS website with eight UNC international students.</ab>

        <ab>Metadata is necessary for finding, using, and properly managing scientific data. This master's paper presents results from a survey studying metadata workflows. A metadata workflow is a workflow that generates metadata for a data collection. A questionnaire was distributed to DataNet Federation Consortium researchers and collaborators. There were fourteen participants representing the following domains: hydrology, biology, climatology, ecology, library sciences, computer science, engineering, social sciences, and information sciences. Data management best practices recommend that data documentation, including metadata planning, occur prior to the data collection activity. However, the results of this survey indicate that in the scientific domains explored, more metadata is created during and after the data collection process than when the activity commences. Results also show that few researchers take advantage of automated metadata generation workflows. In addition, 9% of respondents did not know whether or not a standardized metadata scheme is used in their institution, and 20% did not know whether or not they provide metadata along with their data to repositories. Lastly, impediments to research data sharing and reproducibility were explored, including the need for highly specialized knowledge, software, or equipment. Data curators, librarians, and archivists, along with automated systems, can assist researchers by intervening earlier in the data life cycle in order to produce higher-quality metadata and ensure longterm data preservation.</ab>

        <ab>This project is the first phase of a new online magazine, a resource for young kids presenting topics related to the Brazilian culture. The magazine's goals are to improve knowledge of Brazilian culture, provide fun, and improve reading literacy. Magazines for kids are very popular in Brazil. The magazines are bought on the streets in a newsstand and they are in a comic format. As a result, today Brazilians have a comic book culture. For Brazilians living outside Brazil, magazines are the cheapest and easiest product from Brazil to transfer Brazilian culture to their kids. Not all of them can afford travels or shipping magazines. Many of these families do not speak Portuguese at home and the cultural withdrawal is worsened by the lack of pedagogic material. Revistinha wants to fill this market with a magazine in a comic format presenting topics related to the Brazilian culture.</ab>

        <ab>Students, publishers, and educators have embraced comics for their engaging format and high-interest storylines. Comics are not just popular choices for independent reading, however. Comics can be used in the classroom to support literacy instruction. Comics have been found to foster multimodal literacy, support English language learning, and motivate reluctant readers. The layout of comics makes visible the meaning-making strategies deployed by proficient readers. These strategies include sustained comprehension, visualization, and making inferences. Comics also provide opportunities for readers to explore literacy concepts such as setting and characterization, and literary devices such as foreshadowing, point of view, and flashback. This paper provides a framework for educators to select high-quality comics that can be used to scaffold these and other literacy lessons for K-8 learners. It includes an annotated bibliography of print and digital curriculum guides to integrate comics in the classroom.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines how a sample of scholarly publishers and granting organizations have integrated the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) into their grant application and manuscript submission workflows. The study was conducted to discover what benefits these organizations gain from using the ORCID unique author identifiers and how effective they are at introducing scholars to ORCID as a service. The data was collected through interviews of representatives from a sample of publishing and funding organizations: the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and Technical Information, the Wellcome Trust, Autism Speaks, Elsevier, and Oxford University Press. A representative from eJoumalPress, a software company that provides manuscript management tools was also interviewed. The result is an analysis of best practices for ORCID integration at these types of organizations and suggestions for improvement. The conclusions drawn are generalizable to other institutions seeking to adopt ORCID themselves.</ab>

The survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of crowdsourcing in the archives profession. In addition, the survey sought to gain insight into the level of interest in crowdsourcing among archivists as well as the methods by which archivists have executed crowdsourcing projects. Slightly over half of archivists surveyed indicated they have either engaged in, are currently engaging in, or have plans to engage in crowdsourcing, while seventy-nine percent of archivists who identified as having no plans to engage in crowdsourcing indicated they were slightly to very interested in the subject. In addition, the survey found that archivists execute crowdsourcing in myriad ways and often employ several technologies and competencies simultaneously.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated how North Carolina fiction set in North Carolina has developed over the time period of 2000-2014. The North Carolina fiction studied was fiction held in the North Carolina Collection at UNC-Chapel Hill that had been published in the years 2000-2014 and was blogged on the Read North Carolina Novels blog. Seventy-five books were included in the study, and the genres, settings, and authors of these books were examined. Based on the results of the study, the data revealed that the two most popular genres for the years of 2000-2014 were mystery and romance/relationship. These two genres contain different subgenres and are adaptable to appeal to a wide range of users and also to authors because of their marketability. However, the lack of science fiction/fantasy novels from these years demonstrates the importance of studying North Carolina fiction to determine what is actually occurring within this market.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined the diversity initiatives at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-SILS), as they pertain to the recruitment and retention of students and faculty from historically underrepresented groups. The case study method was used to gauge the extent to which "diversity" as a core value of the Information and Library Science profession has been embraced and implemented within the context of an Information and Library Science (ILS) school. As such, this study addresses the following questions: l.What is the history of the UNC-SILS diversity initiative? 2. How have the objectives of the diversity initiative at UNC-SILS been identified? 3. What major steps have been taken to promote diversity at UNC-SILS? 4. What steps are being taken to assess the success of the short and long term effects of the diversity initiative? What measures will be used?</ab>

        <ab>Previous research has found that annotations Western classical musicians create in their sheet music during ensemble rehearsal play a key role in fostering group coordination during music performance. Despite their important role in musicians' information interactions with sheet music and with each other, a dearth of research exists regarding musicians' annotations. This study conducted a content analysis of annotations that singers in a 100-voice choir created in 158 copies of music while rehearsing two pieces. More than 2,600 annotations were identified and classified according to a coding scheme previously developed by the most extensive study of musicians' score annotations to date. This study characterized choristers' annotations using the coding scheme. This paper offers an assessment of the coding scheme, suggestions for an improved research design, and ideas for future research of musicians' score annotations.</ab>

        <ab>In light of the recent Gamergate controversy, the tension between male and female video game players is as discernable as ever. It behooves behavioral scientists, information scientists, and game developers to investigate the differences between men and women in video game environments, particularly in the ways in which they choose to physically represent themselves for online interaction. Several previous studies observed gender differences in avatar selection and customization, which typically only included human avatars as options to participants. Some of these studies also identified correlations between gender, Big Five personality traits, self-esteem, and avatar selection. The current study sought to improve upon these past studies by presenting other non-human races as additional avatar options. The results of the current study reflected similarities in men and women's avatar selection choices and corresponding personality traits to previous studies in terms of avatar-participant discrepancies in light of the additional non-human race options.</ab>

        <ab>This study looks at the information-seeking behaviors of students enrolled in studio art courses at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and the students' perceptions of the effectiveness of the library instruction session within their art courses. In an effort to contribute new findings to the established discourse on this topic, surveys were distributed to graduate and undergraduate students to determine similarities and differences in behaviors and perceptions. The results of the survey echo the findings of earlier literature on the information-seeking behaviors of studio art students, reinforcing the idea that this population seeks creative inspiration for their works from a variety of sources. Survey results also reveal that a majority of responders have attended library instruction sessions as part of a studio art course and have found these sessions useful in various ways when conducting research for art-based projects.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study is to compare the comprehensiveness of the television collections of a traditional archive, the Library of Congress Online Catalog, and video-sharing websites, YouTube and the Internet Archive. Content analysis was used to compare the collections and descriptions of U.S. television episodes. The collections were compared based on the comprehensiveness of genres and time, as well as the type and degree of descriptions. This study will build upon other research that compared YouTube to traditional archives. It will also provide further information on the similarities and differences between video-sharing websites and traditional archives by comparing three collections that have not been empirically studied before.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a questionnaire survey of the Carolina Hurricanes fan base. The survey was conducted to establish fan interest in oral histories of the Carolina Hurricanes team and staff. 167 responses were received and analyzed. Participants answered three multiple-choice questions and two free-response questions offering opinions about the current state of the identity and team memory of the Carolina Hurricanes. It was determined that fans want more than what is being currently documented and presented as the history of the team. Desired types of information include greater fan recognition and inclusion, team history, and celebration of existence in a non-traditional market, all of which can be effectively captured by oral histories.</ab>

        <ab>Since the accretion of knowledge is a cumulative endeavor, it is a problem that all course materials used by students in UNC's School of Information and Library Science disappears after the completion of each semester. To remedy this problem 1 propose using the LifeTime Library to archive the course materials for each class offered at SILS and make the archive available for students. By creating an easy to use template, adding metadata and rules, students can find information about classes they are interested in taking, as well as access old syllabi, PowerPoint slides, class lectures, assignments, and notes.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last decade, citation of archived scientific data have been the focus of intense debate. However, much of the work on data citation has centered around proposing specific formats for references. In the meantime, scientists have been creating and citing archived data sets, and we thus far lack a deep body of evidence to map the emerging best practices onto actual usage of data references. This study sketches out some of those connections by examining references to data from the Dryad Digital Repository as appearing in articles collected in PMC Europe. I collected examples of references that appear in works cited lists and intratextually, and analyzed the occurrence of references over time, both by themselves and in conjunction with several other factors. This paper offers preliminary insights into current data citation practices, which hopefully can be used to help inform the discussion surrounding data citation.</ab>

        <ab>Training students to work in academic libraries is important work. It is also constant, given the nature of student turnover. Therefore, library managers and trainers should seek efficiencies in training without sacrificing quality. One part of training to examine for efficiencies is LC (Library of Congress) shelving training. This study examines which characteristics the best interactive electronic LC shelving games share per a literature review. Then it compares the performance of twenty shelvers who trained with a highquality interactive electronic LC shelving training tool versus the performance of twenty shelvers who trained with an excellent static guide. The interactive electronic group scored higher on average and experienced fewer low scores on the LC shelving test. More significantly, the interactive group members pinpointed where they made errors, which suggests that library employees trained with interactive shelving tutorials would need less remediation than employees who were trained using static shelving guides.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the online discoverability of multilingual digital collections, focusing on the effectiveness of romanized and original script metadata for providing access to materials in non-roman script languages. Using the World War I Postcards from the Bowman Gray Collection digital collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a case study, the dynamics of Russian-language user access to postcards with and without Cyrillic description were compared with those of other major language user groups accessing the collection. While limited on a dependence on Google's system of determining user language, the results suggest that the nature of the Cyrillic metadata included in postcard records, limited to title, publisher, and other information transcribed from the resource in a bibliographic cataloging context, did not enhance the discoverability of the postcards. Moreover, every language group was at a distinct disadvantage compared to Englishlanguage users in terms of numbers of items discovered. In conclusion, I discuss various factors that may have affected these results, as well as implications for cultural heritage institutions with multilingual and multi-script collections.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated user perceptions of the differences between print and electronic books. Using Marshall McLuhan and others' contention that media are not neutral conduits of information but rather shape the information they convey according to their own affordances and biases, this study focused upon the fundamental differences that are based on each medium's essential nature. Seven such differences were drawn from the literature and were used to categorize comments posted to online discussion boards and blogs using qualitative content analysis. Comparisons on all seven dimensions were identified, with tangibility discussed most and the direction of information flow discussed least. Two additional dimensions emerged during the coding process which may form an additional category. The list of fundamental differences may help cultural institutions prioritize what to digitize and inform the discussion as to why these media may be different and suited to different uses.</ab>

        <ab>The growing realism that has emerged in children's literature in the past several decades has made it possible for more complicated topics such as chronic illness to be considered. Despite the growing presence of illness in children's literature, chronically ill characters are still vastly underrepresented and are often portrayed negatively or only partially. This remains true even as more children are diagnosed yearly with a chronic condition. Research suggests that for children's literature featuring chronically ill characters to be valuable to its young readers, it must be reflective of the realistic emotions and behaviors chronically ill people experience. The "illness experience" has been defined in this paper by medical, social, and emotional factors. The following content analysis considers whether twenty children's picture books published since 2000 realistically present the illness experience of childhood chronic illness.</ab>

        <ab>North Carolina is home to the largest population of American Indians east of the Mississippi River, and the state with the seventh largest Indian population overall. Likewise, the nationwide Indian population is growing at a rate almost twice as fast as the U.S. average. Anticipating the needs of a growing population, it is important that public libraries in North Carolina provide Indian youth with books which provide culturallyaffirming representations of Indian peoples, traditions, and histories. For this study, the nine counties in North Carolina with the largest Indian populations were isolated using 2013 U.S. Census estimates. Then, utilizing the online public access catalogs of the public libraries serving those counties, bibliographic searches were conducted for a selection of 206 books recommended by professional reviewing authorities. The data indicate that less than a quarter of the selected titles have been collected by a majority of libraries in the subset.</ab>

        <ab>This paper discusses the creation of databases specially designed for pediatric drugs. There are many medical drugs databases available currently for adults but there is no database for pediatric drugs that can benefit end users who are looking for information specific to drugs for children. So the Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology in UNC, Chapel Hill wants to have a repository to store and organize information about pediatric drugs in order to provide this information in a structured and easily accessible format that will benefit end users. This database will also be used to provide information to end-users especially consumers about drug repurposing i.e. using the same pediatric drug for more than one purpose.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study is to discover criteria that can be used to predict the type of candidate a process is for automation; good, or poor. Although automation has become the natural solution for organizations to enhance work processes, not all process are best improved by automation. Risks of changing a system with automation were identified in a literature review. Data about process automation projects, collected from IT professionals at a single organization, were analyzed in association with these risks. This study found that a process may be a good candidate for automation if risks to stakeholder interactions, risks in planning and stakeholder interactions, and risks in implementation and stakeholder interactions can be sufficiently managed, whereas a process may be a poor candidate for automation if the risks in planning, risks to stakeholder interactions, and risks in planning and stakeholder interactions cannot be sufficiently managed.</ab>

        <ab>This paper focuses on the technological barriers mobile knowledge workers contend with in their professional activities. In conducting an exploratory study of a small group, themes emerged regarding their technological barriers that eroded their capacity for mobility, which included interacting with associates remotely, incorporating mobile technologies into the suite of professional tools, and building a portfolio of applications and services that prioritized their efficiency. My analysis is developed from concepts in Ubiquitous Computing and sociotechnical theory. By analyzing their barriers and adoptive strategies, I suggest a framework that aims to identify barriers and associate them with solutions.</ab>

        <ab>This paper answers the modem movement of library design toward group spaces and computer workstations, sometimes to the cost of quiet spaces needed for contemplation. The study and observation of places created to inspire contemplation will yield a sampling of common characteristics that will be gathered into a rubric, and which can then be applied to today's theological libraries, helping them remain hospitable to the process of reflection. Not an argument against modem trends, this is a call for the defense of the quiet, the solitude, and the beauty that were once defining hallmarks of every library.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last 25 years, library instruction has come to include not only teaching students how to find sources, but also how to critically evaluate information. A common place for such instruction is the composition classroom, but little research has been done to learn about the attitudes of composition faculty in regards to teaching students these skills. Through interviews with composition instructors in North Carolina State University's first-year writing program (FYWP), this study sought to learn about the attitudes of composition instructors towards teaching students to evaluate sources, including what students should learn and who should teach them. Participants' responses indicate that composition instructors want their students to be able to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources and develop a basic understanding of the context of scholarly communication. In addition, most participants believed that some form of collaboration with the library was the best way to teach source evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>The abusive use of technology outpaces state legislation and law enforcement. Since the 1990s, stalking laws aim to protect men and women from the escalating effects of violence that originates from intimate partners, acquaintances, and strangers. As digital technology weaves into the fabric of everyday life, legislators need to respond to the growing concerns of cyberstalking and other forms of digital abuse. State laws addressing cyberstalking continue to provide protection; however, online and physical safety is an important aspect of an ongoing discussion about the legislation and jurisdiction of the Internet. This paper examines the laws and how they serve as informational resources about cyberstalking behavior. With a content analysis, cyberstalking laws are compared with reported rates of stalking victimization. Although it may be problematic to rapidly develop laws to counteract digital abusers, cyberstalking laws can be designed for the needs of active Internet individuals and communities.</ab>

A literature review looks at the pros and cons of these advancements, and discusses what they mean for the future of museums. A study is conducted and concludes that while digital museums are a fantastic resource, they do not perfectly capture the experience one has within a physical museum.</ab>

        <ab>Childhood obesity is a concern in the United States, with over one-third of children being overweight or obese. Obesity increases children's risks for chronic conditions, premature disability and death. Bibliotherapy is an intervention that encourages individuals to cope with life and health challenges through reading. It has been used to help children deal with issues and can be guided by a trained professional. Because of their professional skills, and the collection of materials in the library, librarians are at a unique position to use bibliotherapy to help children. With the growing emphasis on fighting obesity, many libraries have implemented initiatives and programs that encourage healthy lifestyle choices. This paper examines the extent to which five public libraries in North Carolina collect and circulate children's books promoting physical activity. The paper uses the data collected to assert that the studied libraries have a unique opportunity to help fight childhood obesity.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a multi-modal use assessment of the digital collections and corresponding special collections materials at Wilson Library, the University ofNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill. The study includes: a study of Google Analytics data relating to specific digital collections, an analysis of physical collections use based on metadata provided by the Aeon request system, and a survey-based exploration of current user experiences and expectations regarding materials in Wilson Library's Special Collections. Collections that data indicated were more popular had a higher bounce rate and a lower depth of exploration by patrons than collections with a smaller user population, the use of which suggested an in-depth, purposeful exploration of the collections. Subjects indicated interest as the most likely reason to use physical collection materials or visit a physical exhibit incorporating said materials, but also privileged accessibility and outreach as key components in use decisions. The study indicated an interest, among subjects, in more visible outreach and advertising regarding programming at Wilson Library and a need for greater awareness regarding the accessibility of special collections materials at Wilson Library'.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents case studies of two digitization partnerships, the Tombouctou Manuscripts Project in Mali and the Digital Innovation South Africa project. This paper shows that digitization projects in African countries, which frequently necessitate foreign partnerships, present a situation where alienation of archival materials may occur through dissemination or use agreements. Further, the case studies in this paper do not present clear evidence supporting digitization for preservation through international partnerships: digitization projects involve ethical considerations for archivists and cultural heritage institutions while also affecting decision-making for preservation planning in African archives. Finally, the paper supports the argument that South Africa it is not an exceptional case despite being the African country that is most frequently studied regarding archival issues of digitization and its relationship to collective memory and national identity.</ab>

        <ab>W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) has become the de facto legal standard for web design based on recent settlement agreements. The Department of Justice has even tried to make WCAG the actual law. This paper examines the most common plaintiffs in successful Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) litigation against colleges and universities (individuals with visual impairments) and compares these plaintiffs to individuals with dyslexia, as both populations are covered under the ADA, as both populations have the same affected major life activity: reading. After identifying the 15 overlapping Success Criteria, this review then uses a systematic review methodology to determine when designing for individuals with dyslexia, then it also creates accessible webpages for individuals with visual impairments and when they do not.</ab>

        <ab>This study investigated problematic adult behavior in the teen spaces of public libraries in North Carolina. Data was gathered through surveys and interviews, recruiting participants through the state listserv for children and youth services library staff. The results of this study found that problematic behavior commonly included adult use of space, invasion of teen privacy, predatory behavior, disregard of library policies or signage, and acting as authority figures towards teens within the space. This study concludes libraries should consider the role the physical library layout plays in problematic incidents, as well as foster cooperation among staff outside of youth or teen services in addressing problematic behavior in addition to current strategies for handling problematic adult behavior.</ab>

        <ab>This study uses citation analysis to investigate the influence of Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution in antebellum state court judicial opinions. Specifically, it examines the ways in which the sections of Story's Commentaries dealing with the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution were cited by judges and attorneys between the publication of the Commentaries in 1833 and the beginning of the Civil War in 1861. Such an examination sheds light on the role of law books in spreading legal ideas, and on the history of the book in general.</ab>

        <ab>This study performed sentiment analysis on Tweets created during 30 basketball games. 14,440 Tweets were collected using the Twitter Streaming API, parsed by a script and analyzed using the program SentiStrength. There was significant strong positive correlation between game sentiment of fan Tweets and the outcome of the game. Significant correlation was alsofound between fourth quarter sentiment of fan Tweets and the outcome of the game. Findings suggest that fans participate in live-Tweeting game events as a way to interact with the game and other fans. This study proposes that improvements can be made to sentiment analysis through domain-specific approaches such as improved domain dictionaries and lexicons.</ab>

This included inventorying and cataloging the collection as welfas working on the Resource Library webpage. Finally, the study addresses results of the reorganization process, limitations faced in this particular setting, and lists recommendations for other LGBTIQ groups, organizations, offices, and centers looking to increase the visibility of their collections. By conducting and writing the results of this case study, I hope to contribute to the literature on how LGBTIQ organizations on college and university campuses develop and promote their collections. In particular, I hope to create a template LGBTIQ-focused organizations, centers, and offices can employ to build representative collections and represent their existing resource library in their institution's online catalog.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a project conducted in conjunction with the library at the LGBT Center of Raleigh. Five volunteers were instructed to create catalog records for the same ten books, following only the instructions in a set of procedures called the cataloguing manual. Their work was then briefly discussed. The effectiveness of the manual was evaluated by comparing the participants' records with librarian-created "perfect" records for the same books. Participants' qualitative feedback was then incorporated into the final draft of the manual.</ab>

        <ab>This study performed content analysis on nine library websites, which were deemed to be leading libraries by The Library Journal's Star Index. The content analysis was conducted to determine what America's leading public libraries were doing to market their services. First the cycle of marketing was divided intofour necessary steps: analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. Twelve indicators were developed to represent the different steps in the marketing process. The websites were searched for evidence of these twelve indicators, and the results varied greatly from library to library. Four of the indicators were found on every library's website, showing that public libraries are currently placing importance on library logos and branding, social media accounts, online resources, and patron contact forms. Overall the findings suggest that libraries are doing some steps in the marketing process, but they lack cohesion and connection.</ab>

        <ab>Academic libraries, though situated within universities, are not purely for academic purposes and have made efforts to provide services that support the overall university life of students. These efforts include providing recreational reading materials to patrons. This paper is a case study of one particular leased recreational reading collection at a southeastern university that looks at how these collections are utilized by patrons and perceived by librarians. Circulation statistics for the collection were analyzed and interviews with librarians involved with the collection development and maintenance of the materials were conducted to consider how these collections fit within academia. Additionally, this paper includes a survey of 12 universities with similar collections to determine if the results from one university are broadly applicable to others. Research determined that popular reading collections have a demonstrated use for various patron groups and are valuable to both patrons and librarians.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a content analysis of the websites of interdisciplinary research centers co-located on and associated with university campuses. The purpose of the study was two-fold; first, to determine whether the information needs of interdisciplinary research centers were indicated on their websites, and second, whether these needs appear to be met by current academic library partnerships or services. Little evidence was observed of services or partnerships between academic libraries and interdisciplinary research centers. This analysis fills a gap in the literature, as research on the relationships between interdisciplinary research centers and academic libraries has been limited. The study uses a small sample of twenty-five websites in order to develop themes and categories upon which later research might be based.</ab>

        <ab>Design practitioners have long believed that web interfaces are at a disadvantage compared to desktop interfaces because the web page model may cause change blindness more than non-page based interfaces. To evaluate this concern, a within-subjects experiment was set up to test various change types hi a mock web application. User performance was better when a page loaded as normal and when elements changed instantly on screen compared to a half-second flicker change type. However, change detection rates were only 5% greater and response times only 0.1 second faster for the instant change compared to page loading. This shows that there is some change blindness effect due to the Web's page-by-page architecture, but it is not nearly as disconcerting as practitioners have long believed. Furthermore, single page applications that minimize full-page refreshes may help reduce the incidence of change blindness on the web.</ab>

        <ab>A recent focus in education on the importance of teaching social justice issues necessitates the creation of resources to support teachers and librarians in this work. This annotated bibliography recommends a selection of children's and young adult literature that features social action and social justice in the areas of human and civil rights, labor and community organizing, and the environment and animal welfare. This resource is not comprehensive, rather it highlights a selection of high-quality literature published in the last twenty years that through the genres of realistic fiction, historical fiction, narrative non-fiction and biography, provides models of social action for young people. Through identification with the literary role models in these works, children and teens can begin to understand the myriad forms that social justice can take and be empowered to make change in their own lives. This, then, is a collection of works for exploring the lives of historical change makers, imagining fictional ones, and identifying with the unsung heroes in our midst today.</ab>

        <ab>A contributory archive is one in which individual users may interact with materials through activities like commenting, tagging and sharing, but more importantly they may add content to the collection through uploading items like photos or videos and adding stories and text. This paper examines the community-led contributory archives listed at the website for the UK Community Archives and Heritage Group (www.communityarchives.org.uk), an umbrella organization that provides a central location for community archives, as a case study for expanding our knowledge of user participation in digital archives. This study examines user-generated content in digital community archives including annotations and contributions, the type and frequency of content created, and technical specifications as insight into amateur digital preservation of heritage materials. The information gleaned from this study can be used to assess the effectiveness of community-led projects as a possibility for cultural heritage centers to expand their mission in a participatory platform.</ab>

        <ab>This study has, through crafting a list of competencies for catalogers, analyzing course offerings, and conducting a content analysis of syllabi, attempted to describe the current state of cataloging education in ALA accredited graduate programs for library and information science. A review of the literature has yielded a list of seventeen basic competencies in several different topical areas. Analyzing course offerings has shown that of the fourteen selected schools, all have at least two courses that contained cataloging content. The analysis of syllabi revealed that adequately addressed competencies include cataloging and classification standards, general knowledge of theory and tools, subject analysis, and the theory behind and format of authority records. However, courses do not properly address competencies in the areas of bibliographic utilities, understanding of library catalogs and integrated library systems, practical skills for authority work, an understanding of cooperative programs and groups in the field, and metadata instruction.</ab>

        <ab>The Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP) is a new program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that conducts research and training in health sciences by applying informatics approaches. The CHIP "Faculty, Scholars and Researchers" webpage (http://chip.unc.edu/facultv-scholars-researchers/) provides information about the CHIP faculty and researchers. The goal of this project is to enhance the webpage by adding dynamically updatable information about each member's current research. The goal was achieved by retrieving the information from Google Scholar and PubMed databases by executing the client-side and server-side code written in JavaScript/JQuery, PHP, CCS, and Ajax. A usability study was performed to assess the enhanced webpage. Based on the usability study findings, the prototype system was improved and further suggestions for improvements were proposed. The usability study demonstrated that the developed prototype greatly enhanced the usefulness of the website and helped to achieve CHIP'S goal to provide easy access to the current research information for each faculty member.</ab>

        <ab>Legal citation indexes, known as citators, record and display information about the laterciting history and treatment of a dispositive legal document, usually a judicially published opinion, or "case." Presently, citators are digital tools integrated into large Web-based legal research platforms. This paper analyzes the accuracy with which descriptions of subsequent negative treatment are applied by a citator that employs a hierarchical controlled vocabulary--Shepard's Citations (a LexisNexis product)--as opposed to one that does not--KeyCite (a Thomson Reuters product). A framework for assessment is proposed and employed. The study's results suggest that a system making use of a hierarchical controlled vocabulary does apply descriptions of subsequent negative treatment in a marginally more accurate way. A discussion of the citator's place in legal research follows, including the suggestion that legal research instructors and researchers themselves, namely lawyers, should reconceptualize the role citators occupy in the research process.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature, content and originality of young adult graphic novels adapted from full-text young adult novels. Relevant in that examination is an understanding of the pervasive historical bias against the graphic novel medium held by librarians and educators, arguing that graphic novels hold little redeeming value for readers. However more current research often cites graphic novels as an example of multimodal literacy that is deeply relevant to young adult readers. Using content analysis this paper compares where the adapted graphic novel stands, measuring readability and determining whether these works function as original, supplemental or motivational works.</ab>

        <ab>This study compares two sets of finding aids about the same set of collections, written in die early 1990s and updated in 2011, in UNC's Southern Historical Collection. Instances of race terms, particularly as relating to black people, were compared between the finding aids to discover how representations of race have changed over time. The study revealed a decrease in the use of "negro" with an increase in the use of "African American." The word "slave" in both sets of finding aids most often identified the presence of black people in the collections. Archivists updated their race tenns. but there were ultimately fewer instances of race words, which in some instances lead to a loss of representation.</ab>

        <ab>Sheet music cover art is a seldom studied point of access for users in the modem library. While research is beginning to recognize that users desire greater discoverability via cover art, it is not known how this is being handled currently in music institutions' collections. In this study three institution's collections are studied to establish the community's guidelines and practices for describing cover art. Through comparative case studies, the study found that the process and practice of description for cover art is a complex mixture of standards, research, and institutional limitations. This amalgam, while based in standards, was found to be overall ineffective in presenting cover art for users. Issues of definition, transparency, and aging were identified to compound this.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a content analysis of thirty-one bestselling picture books from the years 2010 - 2014 in order to reveal how women are portrayed to children. The purpose of the study was to discover whether or not young readers are receiving stereotypical gender representations through picture books that can affect their view of gender roles in society. The analysis explores professional roles adult female characters held in these books as well as what they were performing, where they were physically located, and what they were wearing. The results of the content analysis revealed that women are more frequently present in children's picture books than men. These female characters however, are not representative of the abundance of job opportunities available to women today; rather they are predominately depicted as mothers with their primary responsibility being caring for children and other household duties. These results suggest that there has been progress towards gender equality in picture books but there is still more work to be done to ensure that the breadth of male and female gender roles is showcased.</ab>

        <ab>To meet increased demand for library instruction, many academic research and instruction departments rely on pre- and paraprofessional librarians to teach classes. However, due to the general lack of teaching experience these staff members tend to possess at the time of their hire, they often have to receive extra training. This paper documents the process of creating a framework for developing instructors at the University of North Carolina's Undergraduate Library, entitled Information Literacy by Design (ILbD). Based on Wiggins and McTighe's Understanding by Design, this framework acts as supplemental training for new and developing instructors, equips them with a template for creating lesson plans, and provides a web-based outlet for them to share their work.</ab>

        <ab>The past decade has seen significant development within colleges and universities in establishing digital institutional repositories (IRs) for collecting, preserving, and providing long-term access to scholarly production and research assets. Although there has been a correspondingly large amount of research into the role and functioning of IRs broadly speaking, a focused investigation of contributions by Studio Art Departments to these new platforms for sharing research has not yet been conducted. This paper describes the results of an exploratory study which collected the dual perspectives of Art Department and IR administrators to gather information about collection practices for documentation of artworks created by students and faculty, Art Departments' awareness of and engagement with IRs for depositing these collections, and how repositories support digital documentation of artwork in terms of specifications for file types, metadata creation procedures, and access conditions.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines political social media interaction between Members of the United States Congress and the general public on Twitter. Specifically it attempts to gain a better understanding of what motivates a Member of Congress to reply to a tweet by building a model to predict which tweets Members of Congress will reply to. Predicting social media interaction of elected Members of Congress is a challenging machine learning task. MOCs reply more often to positive tweets based on personal interactions they have had and positive feedback. The distribution of reply to non-reply tweets makes predicting responses very error prone. In this process a several methods of predicting rare events in text were attempted with inconclusive results.</ab>

        <ab>The research on on improving the accessibility of descriptive records for cultural objects is extensive. Such studies, ranging from indexing and subject access to experiments with social tagging, have historically focused primarily on art objects to the neglect of other cultural objects, however. Utilizing the Charles Kuralt Learning Center, a collection of historical objects at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, this study explores the needs of a specific user group--researchers with relevant subject knowledge--when using descriptive object records for research. Three major themes emerged during the data analysis process: the contextualization of objects; the relationships between object records; and an interest in confirmation, validation, and authenticity.</ab>

        <ab>"Minimalist" has grown into more than just a buzzword amongst Web designers. In the past ten years, a minimalist design aesthetic has rapidly gained popularity and respect in mainstream Web audiences. Most Web design experts agree that minimalist Web designers approach their work with a 'less-is-more' philosophy: only absolutely necessary graphic and content elements should be included. However, Web design experts differ in the details, and each has a slightly different argument about what characteristics qualify as minimalist. This study surveys the writings of several prominent Web design experts to tease out a working definition of what constitutes a minimalist Web interface. The study then codes a sample of minimalist interfaces based on the most important characteristics of minimalism, as determined by the working definition. The results suggest that visual focus on primary content, flat graphic design, and restricted color palettes are important features of minimalist websites.</ab>

Examining a year of chat transcripts (115 transcripts in total), this study categorized questions as research, ready reference, directional, policy and procedural, holdings/do you own, and reproduction requests. It also examined whether questions asked via chat were answered entirely within the chat conversation or if the staff referred the patron to email in order to answer the question at a later time. The study found that 36.7% of total questions were research questions and that 45% of questions were answered completely in chat while 55% were referred to email.</ab>

        <ab>This plan was created to assess the impact of the Student-Athlete Library Liaison Program on student-athletes' self-efficacy when approaching library resources. The program is an initiative of the library to 'ensure it is meeting student-athletes' information needs. The program uses an embedded model where library tutors hold drop-in hours at the athletic center at UNC. The evaluation action plan includes pre- and post-intervention surveys developed to measure self-efficacy and the impact of immediacy and location on student-athletes' comfort with the library resources. The assessment plan can be implemented by tutors during and after sessions, and this paper discusses potential setbacks and opportunities when libraries evaluate programs involving student-athletes.</ab>

        <ab>The principles of Agile software development promote interactions over tools, but practical application of Agile can demand a considerable amount of structure from software development teams. Vendor software solutions specifically designed for Agile work offer an alternative for many organizations still using manual methods or ill-fitted tools. In this study, we examined task-tool fit between functionality provided by a vetted Agile software solution, and tasks needing to be accomplished by software development teams practicing Agile Scrum methods. A high level of task-tool fit was determined for tasks within several Scrum summary activities. Also evaluated was task-tool fit impact on actual performance of Scrum teams. Quantitative metrics demonstrated an average overall increase in performance after tool implementation for accomplishment of tasks within two Scrum summary activities being measured (Sprint Planning and Sprint Execution). It is suggested this performance improvement can be generally attributed to the determined high level of task-tool fit.</ab>

        <ab>Genealogists make up an important segment of libraries' and archives' user population. This study explores the connection between genealogical research and interest in history to better understand user interests and needs. A survey of three North Carolina genealogical societies was compared to the answers of graduate students at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The results indicate that genealogists tended to be more interested in history in general than the students and revealed some common motivations for genealogical research between the two groups. Both groups enjoyed learning the context of ancestors' lives, exploring the continuity of family traits, and building a narrative. Distinct from the students, genealogists also tended to like community, the learning process, and problem-solving. These findings can help information professionals develop more effective resources for and provide better service to their genealogist patrons.</ab>

        <ab>Since the founding of the Caliphate in June 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has gained worldwide media attention for its campaign of violence across Iraq and Syria. Social media, particularly Twitter, has become a main aspect of ISIS's media campaign. It has been used to spread propagandistic images and videos of ISIS into the Twittersphere. This propaganda is important to ISIS because it spreads their message far past its occupied borders and helps to gain support from a wider audience. Using social media analysis and Twitter's own APIs, this research focused on ISIS's Twitter propaganda campaign and sought to discover the underlying network structure. The resulting network structure - scale-free - is then analyzed to see how it affects ISIS's dissemination of propaganda on Twitter. Ultimately, this research hopes to start a conversation on how network structure can be used to stop terrorist organizations from spreading their message online.</ab>

The model is trained on the MPQA corpus to extract features that correlate with speculative sentences and applied to a collection of SEC 10-K documents from a five year period. The documents with the highest amount of speculation contained a different concentration of terms compared to the entire collection, and the sentences mostly consisted of explaining potential risks concerning projects, taxes, and pensions.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the mission statements of three different law schools and compares those stated missions to the actual practices of the affiliated law school library. In an attempt to better understand the purpose of law school libraries and what influences their practices, librarians at three law schools with differing missions were interviewed regarding the practices, policies and priorities of the library and the results from those interviews were compared to the content of the libraries' related law school's mission statement. The findings in this study prove that the mission of a law school has a great influence on the practices of the school's library, and the practices of those libraries play a significant role in assisting the school in carrying out its mission. In addition, the findings of this study highlights ways in which law school library practices can both differ and be similar.</ab>

        <ab>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have emerged as a way to reach large numbers of students by providing course materials as free online resources. The popularity of these courses has been reflected in high enrollment numbers, however it is unclear how successful MOOCs are at educating their students given their high attrition rates. One cause for this may be due to instructors' inability to manage the large number of students that enroll. While discussion forums are available for students to seek help, instructors are unable to monitor the large number of posts written in these forums. This study investigates the effectiveness of using machine learning models to classify posts into speech acts as a way to help instructors monitor these discussion forums. Speech acts describe the purpose of a post and may be indicative of common functions such as asking questions or raising issues. A linear classifier is compared against a conditional random field (CRF) classifier, which is able to leverage contextual information about the forum in order to make predictions. The results of this study find that CRFs outperform a simpler linear classifier, and this suggests that casting this prediction problem as a sequence labeling task is fruitful for predicting these speech acts, and automatically identifying posts of interest.</ab>

        <ab>Homebound patrons are an often-overlooked population, though their needs like their size are growing. This paper examines literature about the population, their needs and the methods used to reach them. Included is research about several North Carolina public library homebound programs that show real world examples of different delivery methods. Different delivery methods include home delivery and mail delivery. Examination of those methods can be used to determine, from a variety of different methods, which method may be financially feasible for a library seeking to add homebound service in their community.</ab>

Nine nonprofit employees were interviewed to better understand how these organizations use information visualizations to make decisions, plan for the future, and communicate information insights to stakeholders. Expertise and use of information visualization in nonprofits seems to be growing. Interestingly, some nonprofits create information visualizations and tools that foster relationships with stakeholders and spread the use of data to different levels of the organization and various partner organizations. Most nonprofits interviewed use information visualizations on some level in both internal and external organizational activities although many lack standards for creating visualizations and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the visuals they create.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the experiences of a sample of users of the Wilson Library Special Collections. Issues of accessibility, outreach effectiveness, and user satisfaction are addressed, including access to digitized collections, user awareness of outreach activities, and patron experiences with the spaces and resources available for their use. Survey results are discussed and suggest that, from this small sample, user priorities and those of archivists may differ in their scope. When developing collections, outreach programs, collection websites, and other user tools and spaces, special collections professionals should take into account their desired audience and examine their needs as objectively as possible to make such activities as successful as possible.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the use of e-government services by North Carolina county governments. The study was conducted to investigate at what stage of e-government North Carolina counties have reached. Three variables were examined to determine which, if any, could explain the e-government stage where the counties are The three variables were region, economic development tier level, and broadband access. Methods employed over the course of the study included sending a survey to county IT directors and managers, and examining county websites in the case of non-response. Zero counties were found to be at the Presence stage, while 13% were found to be at the Interactive stage, and 87% are at the Transactional stage--which was divided into Early and Advanced Transactional stages for closer inspection. Though the variables individually can impact Internet or e-government uses, none of them completely explain the e-govemment stage of North Carolina counties.</ab>

Analysis of the interviews explores how participants manage their personal digital photographs and the influence of social media on their collection management. The participants discussed why they post photographs to social media, why they delete photographs from their devices and social media, and how they transfer photographs between their multiple devices. They also discussed their photograph management through the lifecycle of a photograph, from capturing, editing, sharing, and storing an image on their devices. The social media sites used by the participants included Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, and Picasa.</ab>

        <ab>This study used qualitative content analysis to examine the way in which adolescent interracial romances are portrayed in Young Adult novels. The purpose of the study was not only to identify the consistent, overarching themes in the novels but also to compare their depiction of adolescent interracial romances to the research on the reality of the experience of these relationships. Seven realistic fiction, YA novels in which the protagonists date interracially were selected for the study, and analyzed in depth using several guiding questions based on the literature, emergent coding, and the constant comparative method. Overall, the study found that the portrayal of adolescent interracial romances in these novels was positive, encouraging the hope for a more tolerant, integrated society in the future. Surprisingly, race was not the focus of most of the novels, and the difference in race was often only a secondary obstacle to the relationships.</ab>

        <ab>The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) of 1938 was instrumental in detaining or destroying solicited and unsolicited mail from the Soviet Union bound for American addressees, including libraries and research centers, until the 1960s. FARA appears briefly in library literature, but no in-depth examination of its mechanisms and effects has been hazarded. This study posits a model for representing the importation and circulation of materials using Roger Friedland and Robert R. Alford's (1991) concept of institutional logics, highlighting the tension created through the competing interpretations of FARA of the Soviet export house, Department of Justice, Department of State, Post Office Department, Customs Bureau, booksellers, and research libraries. FARA's pemiciousness coincided with the library's fundamental shift in institutional ethics, as the profession became politicized amid the coalescence of contemporary notions of intellectual freedom.</ab>

        <ab>Educators and researchers advocate for including graphic novels in both the school library and curriculum, as a wide range of literacy benefits have been identified for both specific groups of youth--and students as a whole. Despite this professional advice however, school librarians differ in the extent and manner in which they collect and promote these materials. This research examined school librarian attitudes, behaviors, and collection habits regarding graphic novels to better understand the reasoning behind collection choices and how these factors were affected by librarians' knowledge of graphic novel benefits. Interview data and collection analyses comparing libraries with study-specified strong and weak collections showed that expressed belief in the importance of graphic novels did not always translate into accompanying levels of use. Those libraries with the strongest collections, however, promoted the format heavily in their own libraries and advocated graphic novel use throughout their schools.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes an examination of the history and current practices of adult programming in two North Carolina public libraries. The examination was conducted to determine the current state of adult programming in public libraries, as well as the factors that have influenced its changes. Public libraries have begun to offer more diverse types of adult programming for their patrons. For example, some categories of programming being offered that have recently grown in prevalence are Entertainment, Arts/Crafts, and Health. This is due to a combination of many factors, and reasons vary between communities. The most significant factor affecting the planning of adult programs is the preferences of an individual community. Librarians must take into account what their communities need and desire from the library in order to have successful programs.</ab>

        <ab>In an effort to move towards a practical and user-centered model for online finding aid navigation, this usability study asks -- what kind of navigational features are effective, efficient, and user-valued components within an academic archive's online finding aid? Using Princeton University's Finding Aid website as a prototype, the researcher collected quantitative as well as qualitative data from ten relatively inexperienced online finding aid users as they interacted with and reacted to the finding aid interface in question. The results of the study suggest major navigational difficulties experienced by users included ambiguous and/or unintuitive labeling, unclear relationships between tabs, and insufficient visual cues for certain navigational features. In contrast, uservalued navigation aids included centralized hyperlinked content, nested and hierarchical content tabs, and a collection-level search bar. The paper concludes with ten pragmatic guidelines for archival professionals trying to solve the ongoing puzzle of online archival finding aid usability.</ab>

On the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, six interviews were done with undergraduate students ranging in ages from 18-22 and across classifications. Students generally found the library as an important space, but there is some hesitancy as to whether it is an important part of the black experience as an undergraduate. They took value in the history and culture preserved in the space, and felt welcome when visiting. Students are also split when deciding whether they would be willing to fight to support the space and feel that it should be better utilized.</ab>

        <ab>The rapid pace of change in scholarly communication in the digital age has led many academic research libraries to adopt new roles as scholarly publishers, while university presses have also been in a state of changing roles. Qualitative research explores both the development of these library publishing services at responding libraries and how these services collaborate and relate to the university presses at their host institutions. Results demonstrate a variety of degrees of collaboration between library publishing services and university presses.</ab>

        <ab>This paper documents the process of creating lesson plans that use primary sources to teach about the movement toward civil rights in Durham, North Carolina. It also discusses the creation of a website designed to house the lesson plans and offers teachers and librarians resources on how to find and select primary sources. The lesson plans were created using backward design, and are grounded in elements of inquiry-based learning. The paper explores the benefits of teaching local history with primary sources, and supports this research by examining how primary sources can help diversify history instruction through critical race theory's concept of counter-storytelling.

        <ab>This study analyzes the political response to and the resulting state budget cuts of the college reading programs at the College of Charleston and the University of South Carolina Upstate in the 2013-2014 academic year. Three participants in the events were interviewed: the directors of both reading programs and one state senator involved with the political debate. Coupled with an analysis of media reports, these interviews provided insight into why and how state politicians elected to cut the budgets for program and how these budget cuts affected the programs. Studying the South Carolina cases provides an example of how reading program directors can cope with political backlash, and how reading programs can simultaneously build and disrupt community.</ab>

        <ab>Physicians frequently raise questions during patient visits and around half of those questions are not even pursued due to various reasons. These unanswered questions represent huge knowledge gap and could lead to negative treatment outcomes. Internet technologies have been developing rapidly. On one hand, Internet provides us numerous information resources. On the other hand, Internet brings us voluminous increase in information and knowledge needs. To make medical information more easily accessible and to facilitate physicians' decision making process, we designed and developed a system that called the Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) to automatically extract and synthesize relevant medical evidence from major resources including UpToDate and PubMed. We performed a usability study involving 10 physicians to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction associated with the use of the system. Physicians in general found CKS intuitive to use and the information delivered valuable in adding in their knowledge gaps.</ab>

        <ab>In today's conflicts, the prevalence of damage to cultural heritage has become a clear and present reminder of the fragility of cultural heritage and humanity's history. However, beyond merely watching as the world's heritage is destroyed, how can information and cultural heritage professionals become more capable of preserving and protecting the collections material in their charge? This paper argues that, through becoming educated on current issues surrounding such destruction and integrating that understanding into current emergency preparedness planning, information and cultural heritage professionals will be better able to prevent and protect against future destruction of cultural heritage around the world. This is accomplished through providing an introduction to emergency preparedness planning, and discussions of cultural property protection (CPP), cultural property protection in war, and cultural property protection in war in the Middle East so as to provide an in-depth analysis of these risks and considerations in contemporary conflicts.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes the findings from coding the transcripts of personal interviews with associate and full professors within the University of North Carolina's School of Information and Library Science. The interviews were conducted to determine whether and how fully-present states of consciousness, known often as flow states in the literature, occurred in the research process. A definite pattern was discovered wherein fully-present states of consciousness were occurring, but most often not during the active work of research, such as reading or writing. Rather, flow came to researchers when they would take a break from their work to do something less intellectually demanding. Here they would receive a personal insight on how to proceed with their work. Then the researchers would return to work to address the challenge of how to package what they had synthesized in their flow experience into language that could be understood and accepted by other researchers.</ab>

        <ab>The main job of a reference librarian is to know where to go for information resources needed by their clients and many of these resources are housed in databases. Fortunately there are programs offering developing countries free or reduced cost access to their journals and books. However librarians in developing countries struggle with finding these organizations. The overarching problem is that they have to deal with a huge or total lack of Internet connection, and this is one of the biggest enablers to the digital divide that is currently and rapidly growing between first and developing countries. This project aims to connect journal providers who provide their content at free or reduced cost to underserved countries to librarians in these countries by means of a hybrid database called Journal Access for Underserved Areas JAFUA.</ab>

        <ab>This study compares the terms used by the LGBT community to describe themselves to those terms used in institutional archives‚Äô finding aids. An archive and LGBT history project website from each region in the United States and one region of Canada was chosen in an effort to examine differences in language uses. The history project websites were examined to find a list of terms used by the LGBT community to describe core identities. These terms were then searched for in the archival finding aids. It was determined that the archival descriptions were often only using general, politically correct terms to describe LGBT collections. There was also evidence that some archivists were describing materials incorrectly.</ab>

        <ab>In numerous contexts, including community question answering systems, school exams, and trivia competitions, a need to assess the difficulty of questions arises. This study examines what features predict difficulty in the realm of trivia questions, considering features related to readability and the question‚Äôs topic as potential contributors. Using clues from the game show Jeopardy!, the study finds that features relating to a trivia question‚Äôs length, the inclusion of audiovisual media, and its constituent noun and verb phrases have a significant impact on the clue‚Äôs difficulty. Based on these findings, this study proposes that finding more nuanced ways to depict the amount of information in a trivia question would lead to further advancements.</ab>

        <ab>Information explosion in every field in this age creates one big challenge - how to extract meaningful information from massive amounts of data. Currently there are millions of datasets available as a result of research by various scientists. It is necessary to find the hidden potential of this data and identify different ways data can be related to each other. The purpose of the project is to identify the level of similarity between the metadata of any two clinical trials that have been completed in Databridge application. The dataset being considered is the entire metadata of all the concluded clinical trials as updated on clinicaltrials.gov. Only the trials which have been completed and have results updated are being considered. This paper discusses four different techniques employed for finding similarity between any two particular clinical trials and their corresponding results.</ab>

        <ab>In 2014, Ferguson, Missouri experienced multiple waves of civil unrest in response to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown and the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer responsible for the shooting. During this time, the Ferguson Municipal Public Library served a crucial role in responding to this community crisis. The actions of this library supported Ferguson‚Äôs community resilience by limiting the impact and helping residents respond, recover, and heal from the civil unrest. A content analysis of the library‚Äôs tweets reveals how the library used Twitter to communicate with the public and support its resilience around both waves of civil unrest. This case study highlights the importance of library disaster planning, roles libraries can play in helping communities plan, respond, and recover from crises, and explores how a library can employ social media to communicate with patrons and support community resilience.</ab>

        <ab>Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have become highly important in health care and consequently in Health Informatics research. Although, some advances have been made, users‚Äô experience of modem commercial EHRs remain challenging at best and unsafe at worst. This paper implements a prototype of EHR system to visualize the history of patient visits in the context of psychiatric care. It reports on a usability study which compared the use of the simulated EHR system by subjects of various experience levels. The study has verified the importance of prior knowledge in the field of EHR. It proposes several suggestions to improve the usability of EHR systems by implementing a temporal data organization scheme to present critical data.</ab>

        <ab>Every year in the United States millions of women are victims of rape, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence. In order to determine what might be done in public libraries to extend support to victimized women and prevent sexual violence, this study sought to identify the information needs of sexually assaulted women. Interviews were conducted with three ‚Äúcompanions,‚Äù or victim advocates, responsible for assisting callers to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center‚Äôs 24-Hour Help Line. The interviews revealed key areas of information need among victims of sexual violence, including information related to reporting crimes of sexual violence, interacting with law enforcement, the procedures of the sexual assault forensic exam, and facts about sexual violence against women. These findings were applied in the development of recommendations for public libraries and librarians seeking to address sexual violence against women in the communities they serve.</ab>

These tools allow searching and analysis to occur that previously had to be done manually. While the tools that are available meet many needs, there is one need that is not being met. The ability to locate unknown allusions has not yet been addressed. This paper explains the benefits of having the ability to locate unknown allusions. In addition, it examines some of the tools that are available and what they are capable to producing. In conclusion, a description of the needed ability of a future tool is provided.</ab>

        <ab>In our society, there is an ever-increasing demand for media, and the need, as much as ever, for ordinary people to think critically about ideas. This paper presents the first steps toward the creation of a visual language that might convey these ideas to an educational software or infographic audience. Since the problem I am trying to solve is one of agreement over abstract symbols, I conducted a paper questionnaire in which respondents selected shapes that they associated the most with a particular one-word concept. In most of the questionnaire categories (nature, order, significance, good, anti-, and divinity), most respondents chose one symbol over the other. Future work is needed to reproduce these results, but the results point to the possibility that we can indeed design a universal visual language of ideas with "dialects" for different cultures.</ab>

This new system allows end-users to generate reports on demand, in either standard Icecast format or the SoundExchange 2013 reporting format. The system was designed to help aid community radio stations in complying with government reporting and regulations. In addition, a plan to increase system availability for ibiblio radio streaming is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Because the records of individual Members of the House of Representatives are considered personal property, what happens to those records once a Member leaves office is up to him or her. Legislative records, particularly files and reports used to develop policy and draft bills, have historical value and are one of the types of files most used in current Congressional collections, as they point toward legislative intent. The House Records Management Manual for Members suggests that offices permanently maintain these types of files. This study reveals to what extent House offices are preserving records that provide future researchers with legislative intent, finding that while congressional staffs are not largely aware of the manual, they do attempt to preserve differing types of legislative background materials. There is a general awareness that their practices have room for improvement, but with no requirements to implement a retention schedule, there is little incentive for congressional staffs to develop better records management procedures.</ab>

        <ab>This paper addresses a need for further collection development in the archives community. As more and more items from popular culture are archived (i.e. movies, music, television, etc.) so should the accompanying fan materials. These fan materials provide important contextual information for their source materials, as well as evidence of the rich cultural history surrounding these materials. To get an understanding of these fan communities, this paper focuses on the large and active Star Wars community. In order to explore the potential archival value of the materials produced by these communities, a qualitative content analysis was conducted of a Star Wars fan fiction, fan podcast, and fan news site. They were analyzed using a contextual entity model designed by Christopher Lee for digital objects, in order to see how the fan materials contextualized and informed on the source materials or Star Wars films. By doing this study, we hope to encourage archives to expand their collections and consider this new type of material that expands the overall cultural history.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines and compares how decentralized IT departments serving Library and Information Science (ILS) programs operate. An online survey was sent to 47 American Library Association (ALA) accredited ILS IT departments in the United States. Survey questions focused on demographics, budget, and current and future operations of the IT departments, along with perceptions of the respondents. Two programs emerged within the survey, those with an internal IT department within the ILS school and those with a hybrid mix of an internal IT department and support from central IT. The hybrid IT respondents were more macro focused and served several colleges within the university. The internal IT respondents served larger populations, had more employees and student workers, and higher budgets in comparison to the hybrid IT respondents. Both groups had similar revenue sources and spending trends. Priorities and day-to-day operations differed among all respondents as each department had unique IT solutions.</ab>

        <ab>A gap currently exists between the level of instructional training needed for public service librarians to succeed, and the level being provided by employers and LIS programs. Communities of practice (CoPs), as described by Lave and Wenger, provide a sustainable, practice-centered model for instructors of all experience and skill levels to grow individually while supporting each other. This paper documents the analysis of redesigned instructional training for the instruction team at UNC-Chapel Hill's Undergraduate Library (UL), centered around Information Literacy by Design (ILbD). Interviews with instruction team members are coded to track indicators of CoPs, which reveal key trends involving peer relationships, self-efficacy, and ways of learning. The redesigned training is revealed to have influenced the development of a community of practice among the UL instruction team.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a questionnaire survey of library directors, county librarians, and city librarians representing eighty-three of California‚Äôs one-hundred and seventy-nine total public library districts. The study was conducted to determine the effects, if any, of the 2015 Disneyland measles outbreak and California Senate Bill Number 277 on public library policy in California. One library district changed an existing policy following the Disneyland outbreak, and another district changed an existing policy in response to the Senate Bill. No library districts added, eliminated, plan to change, plan to add, or plan to eliminate policies owing to either event. Three districts anticipate that these events will likely impact policies in the future. Although the events have yet to elicit many policy changes, public libraries should consider implementing such policies to strengthen the health of the communities they serve before governing bodies place pressure on them to do so.</ab>

We combined machine learning classification techniques with Loughran and McDonald Sentiment Word Lists (Master Dictionary), and built the Python program from scratch Text transcripts as well as stock prices were captured online. Transcripts were labeled according to sentiment scores defined by us. After a three-way data split, all six algorithms failed to result in an ideal accuracy. The results suggest that earnings call transcripts are not informative enough to predict stock price changes.</ab>

Millennial have overtaken the Baby Boomer generation as the largest age group in America. Regarding the generation‚Äôs population size, why haven‚Äôt millennial been widely studied in the genealogy community? Few studies about millennials and genealogy leave numerous questions left to be answered: How much is known about the millennial generation in genealogy studies? What thoughts do millennials have in regards to genealogy? What factors drive their feelings? The researcher conducted a genealogy-based survey with millennials at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in hopes of uncovering answers about this generation. The findings of this study will help institutions to better understand millennials as recognized members within the genealogical community.</ab>

        <ab>Use of health tracking devices by Digital Natives has drawn the attention of the health tracking technology industry. Despite that, it is not clear how those technologies really work for them in their life contexts, and more study is needed to understand how they interact with the large amount of information generated by these technologies. My study borrowed the Savolainen model of everyday information practice as a theoretical lens to focus on life contexts around the use of health tracking technologies. The data was collected qualitatively, through semi-structured interviews with nine college students. In the findings, information practices, personal life contextual factors, and technology enablement are identified. In evolving relationships among these factors, how information affordance was offered was discussed. Many information practices still relied on manual means, as reflected by life contexts.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes the application of a part-of-speech tagger to a particular configuration of historical German documents. Most natural language processing (NLP) is done on contemporary documents, and historical documents can present difficulties for these tools. I compared the performance of a single high-quality tagger on two stages of historical German (Early Modem German) materials. I used the TnT (Trigrams ‚Äòn‚Äô Tags) tagger, a probabilistic tagger developed by Thorsten Brants in a 2000 paper. I applied this tagger to two subcorpora which I derived from the University of Manchester‚Äôs GerManC corpus, divided by date of creation of the original document, with each one used for both training and testing. I found that the earlier half, from a period with greater variability in the language, was significantly more difficult to tag correctly. The broader tag categories of punctuation and ‚Äúother‚Äù were overrepresented in the errors.</ab>

        <ab>This paper investigates the libraries‚Äô role in collaborative digital humanities projects through an anonymized case study of Project Beta. Digital humanities collaborations are becoming increasingly common in libraries, but there is a dearth of scholarly literature articulating the experiences of and challenges faced by people actually doing this work. This study aims to contribute to a shared knowledge about how libraries can effectively partner with scholars to create innovate digital scholarship. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders on Project Beta, which illuminate the institutional, social, and technical challenges associated with creating and sustaining a digital humanities project in the library. Recommendations for addressing the identified challenge areas are made based on the holistic picture provided by interviewees.</ab>

        <ab>There is a distinct lack of current and specific guidance on the creation of content for social media in cultural heritage institutions. This study aims to remedy that lack of specificity by examining user responses to social media strategies employed by cultural heritage institutions and in so doing, identify and evaluate emerging trends in social media content generation. In order to accomplish this task, the researcher conducted an analysis of the British Museum‚Äôs Facebook page. This consisted of evaluating posts according to a coding schema and recording the level of user response to each post. This method allowed the researcher to identify past, present, and emerging trends as well as the efficacy of each trend in terms of user interaction.</ab>

        <ab>Unnecessary hospital readmissions are a major problem impacting millions of patients and costing billions of dollars per year. Unfortunately, accurate assessment of readmission risk remains an open problem. In this study, several methods and tools for readmission prediction were developed using UNC hospital data available from April 1, 2014 to November 1, 2014. This study investigated the change in readmission risk for patients over time to explore at which times high-risk patients can be most effectively identified. Toward this goal, multiple Machine Learning models of hospital readmission using patient history prior to admission and comparing them with baseline model which uses data during hospitalization were developed. The results of this study find that patients history did not produce better predictive performance than the baseline model that considered just hospitalization data. However, the dataset considered is small and results may not generalize to large data sets over longer period of time.</ab>

        <ab>This study is a qualitative survey and review of tacit and explicit knowledge management in an organizational context. It involves qualitative research and interview of fifteen employees and system designers in a medical malpractice insurance environment regarding their knowledge management habits and needs. Traditionally, research has divided knowledge management into tacit and explicit knowledge. Models have emerged which state certain types of organizations should primarily focus of explicit knowledge management while others should focus on tacit in an 80/20 ratio. Further research intimated that 80/20 as a strict guideline should be eschewed in favor of strategies that bridge the gap between the two. In this organization, explicit knowledge needs rarely exist and primarily serve to orientate new employees, while tacit needs and opportunities continually exist regardless of employment duration.</ab>

        <ab>Instruction librarians are often expected to promote academic integrity. However, the content and implementation of institutional academic integrity policies may vary greatly from one university to another. This study employed a mixed methods approach, combining content analysis of policies and a survey of librarians involved with instruction. The policies analyzed and the librarians surveyed were from UNC and its fifteen peer institutions. The results of the document analysis identified at least three distinct types of policies defined by their length, use of legal language, and overall purpose. The survey results suggest that although academic librarians understand and are cognizant of their universities‚Äô academic integrity policies, they are not strongly influenced by these documents. This study contributes to the existing literature on academic integrity policies while also beginning to bridge the gap between that body of literature and our understanding of the roles played by librarians in supporting academic integrity.</ab>

        <ab>In the present era, archivists are increasingly tasked with documenting the aftermaths of tragic events. This paper explores the development of the April 16, 2007, Condolence Archives at Virginia Tech, following a mass-shooting at the university in 2007. It covers topics such as the objective and scope of the collection, archival appraisal, and exhibition of materials. It also examines examples of items in the collection, as well as the personal experiences of stall involved. Finally, this paper analyzes this collection in regards to general archival collection development, material culture and memorialization, and the development of collective memory.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is a content analysis of seventeen chapter books geared towards upper elementary and middle school aged children that feature twenty-three intellectually gifted child characters. The books were analyzed for the presence of themes mentioned in literature on the subject (isolation and resulting desire for acceptance, normalcy, and belonging) as well as gifted stereotypes often seen in media. The overall portrayal in the books of the gifted population‚Äôs abilities was then compared to the real distribution of cognitive abilities in the population. Themes were largely handled well, with positive resolution for most characters, and stereotypes were mostly avoided. There was, however, an overrepresentation of profoundly intellectually gifted characters.</ab>

        <ab>This study presents the results of a survey distributed to first-year undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The survey examined instruction offered at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill‚Äôs Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library to undergraduate students during the spring semester of 2015. Focusing on first-year undergraduates enrolled in the University‚Äôs required introductory English course, the survey collected information about the student experience in special collections instruction and the impact of instruction on the ability of undergraduates to conduct research at Wilson Library. The survey produced thirty-five responses and revealed that students, while largely unfamiliar with special collections research, found the instruction session useful and relevant to their immediate needs. Survey responses also revealed a number of challenges faced by both students and library instructional staff and suggest that future instruction may benefit from changes in practice.</ab>

        <ab>Search log data from the Ackland Art Museum‚Äôs online collection search system was analyzed in order to determine the search categories most frequently employed by users of the system. The data consisted of a total of 16,729 actions and 3,459 search sessions. It covered a three-month time period from February 19 to May 19, 2015. Analysis of actions associated with the Ackland‚Äôs advanced search feature suggest that the department, classification, and artist fields have the highest usage while searchers rarely submit queries relating to a work‚Äôs particular medium (2.55%). Review of the most common queries submitted by users reveals that search terms most commonly relate to representational subjects visually presented in a work of art rather than formal titles. Investigation into how users alter the queries they submit throughout a search session indicates that users often do not change categories during a search session, but primarily make parallel changes (68.11%).</ab>

        <ab>Though undergraduate libraries have changed since they were first conceived of and implemented more than half a century ago, the published definitions of undergraduate libraries have not. This paper explores proposed definitions of undergraduate libraries to determine if they are accepted by contemporary undergraduate librarians. Five librarians who work at Robert B. House Undergraduate Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were interviewed using a card sorting task to determine which definitional criteria they considered most important, which criteria could be eliminated, and which additional criteria could be added. It was found that, though disagreement existed over which roles the Undergraduate Library should prioritize, the participants favored a simple definition that outlined the population served rather than listing the roles the Undergraduate Library should fill.</ab>

        <ab>Models for teaching information literacy have multiplied in the last decade in dutiful response to the digital barrage and increasing ubiquity of information. Meanwhile, models for visual literacy, despite an even greater proliferation of images in this same environment, have lagged behind. Although information literacy frameworks partially address the skillset for visual information, there are nuanced competencies critical to visual literacy that are wholly unaddressed by current conceptions of information literacy. This study pinpoints and articulates those visual literacy-specific skills by activating and analyzing the pedagogical content knowledge of experienced instructors of visual media and gauges those findings against ACRL‚Äôs Framework for Information Literacy. Discoveries move the author to propose two major threshold concepts, articulated through the frames Close and Critical Looking and Creative Vision, which are critical and specific to visual literacy.</ab>

        <ab>Consumers often have little knowledge about the extent of privacy risks taken when using mobile applications (apps) on their smartphones, and are unlikely to be informed by federal regulations or privacy certifications. A survey was distributed to smartphone users to determine their perceptions and knowledge of privacy risks in mobile apps, and if these perceptions vary in different contexts (i.e., a health app vs. flashlight app). This study found that people appear to see privacy in mobile apps as contingent and contextdependent. While smartphone users were found to have a good understanding of privacy risks, they considered user rating and price to be more important factors to consider than privacy when selecting a mobile app. Presentation, clarity, and context all influence people‚Äôs decisions to install and use mobile apps. This study has important implications for how privacy permissions and ratings can be presented to best inform consumer decisions.</ab>

The system was implemented using Apache Solr as the indexing and searching platform, on top of which I built my own algorithms and methods for document indexing and retrieving. The development of this system involved source document collection and tagging, indexing algorithm design and implementation, and system evaluation. Progress to date has shown that both precision and recall have been improved when searching using event-relevant key words and this also provide a way to retrieve entities combine with events.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores how differences in the amount of details in visualization impact the decision-making process. Everyday decisions like buying a used car are the focus of the study. A visualization tool that is able to show different number of attributes was designed and developed using JavaScript library d3. Twenty users participated in the user study and were asked to make car-buying decisions based on the observation of different levels of details of car information presented in the developed visualization tool. Two patterns of the decision-making process were summarized. The increasing number of details in information visualization does not always influence participants‚Äô decisionmaking, while the value range and the level of importance of the newly added attributes turned out to be more influential on participants‚Äô decision-making processes. A weak correlation between level of confidence and the number of details in information visualization is found.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a case study conducted in three different varieties of law library in North Carolina. Public, private, and hybrid libraries were studied to determine if any meaningful difference existed between the types as to the level of legal materials and services available to members of the general public. Although much research has been conducted on why people file pro se, little research has been done on how they, and other public patrons, are able to access legal information once they determine that they need it. The results of this study indicate that two libraries showed no major observable difference, despite being different library types, while one library stood out as being much less helpful in allowing public patrons to access legal information. Results of this research may be of interest to public service attorneys, members of the public conducting research, law librarians, and anyone determining funding for law libraries.</ab>

Salient thumbnails were evaluated against a baseline by running a lab study that assessed the thumbnails‚Äô usefulness during finding and re-finding tasks. Results did not find any significant difference in time, user confidence, or user preference of salient thumbnails compared to the baseline. However, salient thumbnails resulted in improved accuracy during re-finding tasks, suggesting that they may offer some advantage for representing archival correspondence.</ab>

        <ab>Intertwining public memory, community archives, and technology, St. Joseph‚Äôs C.M.E Church, the University of North Carolina‚Äôs Southern Oral History Program (SOHP), and the Marian Cheek Jackson Center for Saving and Making History documented the legacy of the minority and working class voices within the Northside and Pine Knoll neighborhoods in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Having preserved hundreds of oral interviews with a social justice orientation, the narratives were transformed into a physical and digital archive. This paper uses a case study approach to explore the Jackson Center‚Äôs ethnographic framework and survey methodology used to entice community participation and examines 1) The application of oral and public history to document marginalized communities that may be underrepresented in traditional archival repositories 2) The definition of community archives 3) The role of Community Informatics in galvanizing support for the digital archives and 4) The implications of archival custody and the future for wider use.</ab>

        <ab>Technology and other factors have radically altered the character of teaching, learning and research in higher education. In order to continue to meet the needs of their communities, academic libraries have introduced new spaces and services responding to these changes. Using semi-structured interviews with key librarians and administrators, this study uses the research commons at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill‚ÄîThe Edge and The Research Hub, respectively‚Äîas case studies, in order to better understand how libraries identify, plan and create new initiatives to serve their communities. The interviews demonstrate that both libraries exist in a complex research environment and that their ability innovate is dependent on understanding these environments in order to responsively position their spaces and services.</ab>

        <ab>Readers‚Äô advisory is a central job of librarians who work with youth, and it is especially critical for youth who are struggling or reluctant readers. Readers‚Äô advisory is often conducted based on gender, partially due to the fact that boys are more often seen as reluctant readers, and score lower on reading measures. As there is growing awareness that not all youth fit into the classic definition of a gender binary, librarians must reconcile the needs of reluctant readers and the needs of gender non-conforming youth. This study examined what youth librarians in school and public libraries understand about using gender in readers‚Äô advisory. The study consisted of four semi-structured interviews with youth librarians, exploring the issues of readers‚Äô advisory, gender, and gender non-conformity.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the rates of data production for US law enforcement agencies deploying Body Worn Camera and DashCam systems. Analysis estimates that local law enforcement agencies can reasonably expect to produce 33.9 individual video files, totaling 11.1 hours of video, and (depending on the video capture quality) requiring between 10-20 gigabytes of storage space per officer, per month. The study also demonstrates that video file production rates from existing DashCam systems can be an effective benchmark when considering the implementation of a Body Worn Camera system. Finally, the study finds that of all implementation policies examined, only two policies demonstrated significant positive impact on video capture rates: 1) if officers were required to inform citizen of camera in operation, and 2) if officers were allowed to view footage prior to making a shift report.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the workforce development programs implemented at the Cumberland County Public Library. The case study focuses on the specific initiatives and evaluation methods implemented by the library for workforce development programs. Analysis indicates that the efforts and initiative of library personnel is a key factor in successful implementation and evaluation of workforce development programs in addition to in-depth research and innovative approaches to data collection. Funding plays an important but supplementary role in supporting initiatives. Finally, job fairs are key workforce development initiatives which illustrate the findings in the paper.</ab>

        <ab>A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews to describe how seven black male librarians‚Äô dual minority status within the profession influences the construction of their professional identities. Recently, successful professional identity construction has become an important theme in career literature because it has often been associated with career success. However, career literature fails to link the influence social identities have on the construction of professional identity, particularly if those identities are in some way marginalized within that profession and/or stigmatized within the society at large. Black male librarians hold both a marginalized and stigmatized identity in their profession and American society through their race and gender. Yet, in Library and Information Science (LIS) literature, there is little focus on the intersection between professional and stigmatized social identities, particularly when it comes to race and gender. This study addresses the knowledge gap in LIS literature.</ab>

        <ab>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines health literacy as ‚Äúthe degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions‚Äù. One of the antecedents of health literacy, patient empowerment, has seen an increase from the participation of patients in online health communities. In this study, 4367 group forum posts from 215 users of Anxiety Connect, a moderated online health community, were analyzed using the patient empowerment processes and outcomes of Bartlett and Coulson. Patient empowerment was evident in the forum posts. Every post contained evidence of at least one empowerment process; X% of the posts contained evidence of at least one empowerment outcome. The empowerment process most prominent in the Anxiety Connect forum was sharing experiences, included in 57.6% of Total Posts. The empowerment outcome most prominent was increased acceptance, included in 5.1% of Total Posts, closely followed by optimism and hope for the future and increased social well-being, included int 4.5% and 4.7% of the Total Posts respectively. These findings have implications for the design of moderated online health communities.</ab>

        <ab>Scheduling and coordinating a sport game with multiple participants is increasingly complicated. It is particularly difficult to account for participant's travel schedules, and to accommodate those participants from different places to go to the same event. A simple online reservation system that allows people to sign up for recurring sports events is in demand. This project implemented a high-efficiency and user-friendly online reservation system for local sports game met-ups. The features included creating events, joining existing events, search events, cancelling events, and communicating between group members. We conducted a usability study to test the system and concluded that the system is helpful in improving user experience.</ab>

        <ab>People have different mental strengths and weakness, which can be measured according to cognitive ability. Learning about strengths and preferences in terms of search behavior, and looking for patterns between behaviors and cognitive abilities, creates the opportunity to make search tools and systems more effectively meet user needs and preferences. While we know that different cognitive abilities exist, and that people form and reform search queries in a variety of ways, we do not know how these two elements interact, or if the interaction is predictable or significant. This paper performs secondary analysis of data collected during a study of cognitive ability, adding in the element of query reformulation moves. It assesses the effect of these cognitive abilities on study participants‚Äô search formulation behaviors. Analysis showed that the most common search move was adding a concept to a query, followed by deleting concepts and manipulating search terms. Of the cognitive abilities, the only statistically significant differences between high and low groups were found in the visualization ability. Those in the high skill group made significantly more moves, and significantly more term manipulation moves, than their low skill counterparts.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents an evaluation of the spectral clustering segmentation algorithm used for automating the description of musical structure within a song. This study differs from the standard evaluation in that it accounts for variability in genre, class, tempo, song duration, and time signature on the results of evaluation metrics. The study uses standard metrics for segment boundary placement accuracy and labeling accuracy against these song metadata. It reveals that song duration, tempo, class, and genre have a significant effect on evaluation scores. This study demonstrates how the algorithm may be evaluated to predict its performance for a given collection where these variables are known. The possible causes and implications of these effects on evaluation scores are explored based on the construction of the spectral clustering algorithm and its potential for use in describing diverse music collections.</ab>

        <ab>This paper establishes an argument for the beneficial roles makerspaces can provide in school library programs. It builds a bridge between formal and informal education by grounding it in current accepted educational theories and frameworks including constructivism, constructionism, inquiry-based learning, and Backward Design. The paper stresses the importance of understanding adolescents and how they learn in a school library makerspace. It also addresses the role of school librarians as collaborators and their responsibility to conduct evidence-based practice. The final product resulting from this work is a makerspace collaboration guide intended for use by school librarians. It provides tools for facilitating productive collaborations between the school librarian, teachers, students, and community members. A version of this collaboration guide is available for download and modification atjennytheIibrarian.wordpress.com.</ab>

        <ab>This paper introduces the concept of fan fiction and identifies distinctions between professionally published fan fiction, self-published fan fiction and online fan fiction as a way of presenting online fan fiction as a useful tool for reader‚Äôs advisory and creative writing education. Using a sample of five texts for each of these three categories, this paper analyzes the works‚Äô contents for characters, settings, plots and themes from the original novel on which they are based, Jane Austen‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice, as well as the type of sequel and genre. The findings describe what distinctions are found in the samples as respect these concepts and support the use of online fan fiction as resources for readers and writers.</ab>

        <ab>This study is a systematic review of literature on electronic health record systems (EHRs) and the evaluation methods performed to study their usability. The purpose was to identify and review the extent of usability testing methods in their respective clinical environments. Full text review was completed for 121 of 753 titles intentionally identified, and 70 final articles were included. The majority of methodologies reviewed were well-established in HCI and the most common was the questionnaire. There was a wide range of study designs in terms of user populations (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physical therapists and others), clinical settings (inpatient and outpatient, ambulatory, pediatric, intensive care units, and others), testing time (pre-implementation or post), and qualitative data analysis. Chosen methodologies and study designs closely depended on study goals, but all of them had large implications for the future of quality healthcare and how to obtain it.</ab>

        <ab>This study discusses the results of a heuristic evaluation of 80 public library websites in the state of North Carolina. Each public library website (PLW) was evaluated using a usability heuristic questionnaire, with questions covering criteria taken from human-computer interaction literature. Development of this questionnaire allowed a broad evaluation of 80 North Carolina PLWs to be conducted. The purpose of the study is to understand the extent to which PLWs in North Carolina meet basic usability heuristics. Developing a method of evaluation that can cover many PLWs of a specific locale allows librarians to use shared governance in future opportunities for investigation and improvement of websites in North Carolina public libraries. Results show that North Carolina PLWs meet some usability heuristics but not others, and that most North Carolina PLWs are more usable than they are unusable.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to design, build and evaluate an interactive visualization tool for data analysts to analyze as well as interact with the live chat data from a corporate website for customer relationship management. Sales lead and customer support are the major purposes of the live chat service. Data mining technologies are applied to classify the chat data into categories that can help marketing and sales teams to target their potential customers more accurately and efficiently. By interacting with the web visualization tool, data analysts will have the capability to obtain valuable information about customers‚Äô concerns and buying interests on their products and solutions. The results indicate that chat classification achieves higher accuracy on major class ‚ÄúLead‚Äù but lower accuracy on minor classes due to the imbalanced distribution of dataset as well as human bias when manually labeling the training data. Based on the analytic results of chat visualization, data analysts gain the knowledge gap between customers‚Äô concern and the information provided on the corporate website, and propose new ideas to improve their digital marketing approaches as well.</ab>

        <ab>Graphic novels, a large and growing part of the popular culture, are found across society from private homes to University Libraries. They have been found to be of benefit to early and reluctant readers and are also used for other tasks in the private and business sphere. As graphic novels become more popular, new forms of page layout are appearing. This exploratory study examined how university undergraduate's eyes traveled across specific ‚Äòdominant/inset‚Äô page layouts. Participants' eye tracking data were collected using a Tobii Pro X2-30 Eye Tracker. Participants' scanpaths were analyzed using visual analysis techniques to determine how closely they corresponded to the Chronological Sequence Path set by creators. This study found that readers more familiar with graphic novels read these pages in a smoother fashion and were less likely to revisit text than novices.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a questionnaire survey of librarians responsible for audiobook selection in the public libraries of North Carolina. The survey was conducted to determine the selection criteria employed by those librarians for audiobook selection, how they differed from print, and how technological change affected the process. The criteria used by public libraries to select audiobooks vary, but are largely similar to that of print materials. Responses show that patron demand is the most influential factor in audiobook selection, and that budgetary restrictions heavily shape the collection. The trend towards digital media has had a significant effect on the way that libraries build their collections, but a consensus on providing digital audiobooks in public libraries has not been reached. Currently, audiobook selection is based primarily around popularity.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a survey of Hispanic and Latino students at a major research university in North Carolina. The purpose of the survey was to determine students‚Äô satisfaction with and use of the university‚Äôs libraries. The study also included six interviews with students, which discussed more in-depth their attitudes toward library use at their university and their research processes. Hispanic and Latino students are at a higher risk for dropping out of college during their first few years than many of their counterparts. There are a number of factors which influence this dropout rate; among them is a lack of support on campus. When students do not identify with their librarians they become less likely to approach librarians for assistance with coursework. The interviewees‚Äô feedback supports the literature which claims that Hispanic and Latino students are hesitant to approach librarians and are not necessarily confident in their research abilities.</ab>

        <ab>Digitization of health records has opened avenues for intensive research in the fields of health informatics. Power of machine learning, statistical analysis and visual analytics could be utilized to make optimal use of this information. The proposed project is to develop an interactive visualization tool that summarizes a patient‚Äôs medical history, highlighting all his/her important events based on the knowledge of similar patients. Given a set of patients with common conditions, statistical analysis can be used to develop models that prioritize features based on associations between features and condition-specific outcome measures. This manuscript in particular describes the model developed to prioritize a patient‚Äôs events from his medical history. The model is trained with the population of patients and their events. Their correlations with the outcome variable are calculated to identify the important events in a specific cohort. This correlation score can be used to prioritize the events associated with an individual patient. This model is one of the models that will be used to summarize an individual patient‚Äôs medical data via interactive visualization methods.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the differences in the proportion of non-English language citations given to English language articles published in open access and traditional library and information science journals. It compares the average percentage of foreign language citations to total citations between 207 open access articles and 196 traditional articles published between 2011 and 2012. An independent, two-tailed t-test found no statistically significant difference between the foreign language citation percentages of open access and traditional articles. An analysis of variance also found no significant difference in the proportion of citations given by each non-English language according to journal type.</ab>

        <ab>Crowdsourcing has gained popularity over the past few years as a way for library and archive professionals to supplement and enhance the description of their collections. This paper provides case studies of four community archiving projects, focusing on crowdsourcing techniques they used to describe or enlarge their collections. The studies were conducted to determine the kinds of techniques used in community archives, and the potential benefits and barriers they faced in developing and using the techniques. Analysis of the projects indicated that the up-front investment in developing crowdsourcing tools may be prohibitive for community archiving projects. However, the results also indicated that digitization projects were still of value.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to explore whether students with experience using archives search finding aids differently than students no experience. A usability study was conducted using four different finding aids from four institution with eleven undergraduate students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The participants were recorded completing the tasks and were asked to describe their searching methods and the challenges they faced while completing the tasks during a stimulated recall session The results found that students used a multitude of searching methods in their attempts to answer the questions. The experienced users used more advanced techniques to find the answers but were less successful that the inexperienced participants on most of the tasks. The participants also struggled with archival terminology as well as the websites themselves while searching for materials. However, the participants were mostly successful in searching the library websites and locating finding aids.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a survey given to school librarians regarding their provision of professional development opportunities for teachers. Librarians who are members of AASL Forum and LM_NET were emailed the survey. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time allocated and/or spent by school librarians on staff development related activities and to identify the variables within the school community which inhibit or contribute to those activities. School Librarians‚Äô professional development activities were assessed using the AASL‚Äôs Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs. The survey results of 230 participants showed that librarians provide large group PD about 0.57 times per month and one-on-one PD about 5.3 times per month; however, most librarians would ideally provide more PD opportunities than they currently provide. Responses also showed that the most common factors contributing to and inhibiting the provision of PD were teacher cooperation and lack of time, respectively.</ab>

        <ab>Academic integrity education is often framed in the context of plagiarism, which is typically taught to undergraduates through teaching citations. While this has generated attention and conversation on college campuses, issues of plagiarism and academic integrity have remained largely unaffected. High rates of academic integrity issues in specific demographics, such as international and transfer students, suggest that our definitions of plagiarism and academic integrity are potentially culturally bound and cannot be simply transferred through submitting to an honor code. UNC-CH's R.B. House Undergraduate Library and the Office of Student Conduct have partnered to create a plagiarism tutorial that better meets the challenges of changing information uses in education and offers a more inclusive approach to academic integrity education. This tutorial focuses on skill development and uses methods and concepts prevalent in pedagogical theory to help students develop a better understanding of the issues surrounding plagiarism.</ab>

        <ab>Vertical search in Information Retrieval (IR) represents display opportunities for searcher interaction in the form of blended and non-blended results. Search behavior and preference in interacting with these results can be influenced by both design and personal, cognitive abilities. This study evaluates the relationship between cognitive ability and vertical search behavior and preference. In this lab study cognitive tests measuring perceptual speed and visual memory were administered to sixteen participants who subsequently performed four search tasks on two search engines, one with a blended display and one with a non-blended display. Cognitive tests, search logs and participant questionnaires were used to evaluate vertical search behavior and preference in cognitively high and low performers. The findings suggest that cognitive ability influences vertical search engagement and preference. The value in this research is its ability to contribute to issues of result merging, display, and interaction at a personal level in vertical search.</ab>

        <ab>Social media has played a significant role in recent activist movements. It empowers activists to organize, and communicate their experiences. Archival efforts to document narratives that are historically silenced makes activist material an attractive collecting area. However, archives trying to preserve digital ephemera like social media from activist movements face digital preservation challenges as well as ethical considerations. By conducting online surveys and semi-structured interviews with archivists working on projects collecting activist social media this study found that activist social collecting projects: 1) face ethical and collection development challenges, 2) usually follow traditional models for acquisition, description, and access, and 3) increase donor and user engagement with collections. This suggests that in the future the profession would benefit from the development of best practices surrounding ethical collection development and use of activist social media.</ab>

        <ab>The cabinet of curiosities, or collection of the exotic and the obscure, was a product of the Renaissance. Efforts by the elite to acquire and display natural and man-made marvels served a dual purpose: to illustrate prestige and to support intellectual pursuits. In regard to the latter, this paper suggests three uses of the Renaissance cabinet: as a refuge, conducive to creativity and critical thinking; as a laboratory, facilitating experimentation via the arrangement or observation of objects; and as a forum, to inspire intellectual conversation. Linking the historical cabinet to its contemporary counterparts, this paper examines similar attributes in three modem exhibits on display, or displayed, at the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, and the Canadian Museum of Civilization. It concludes that the cabinet of curiosities remains a relevant model for exhibit design, that the appeal of the unexpected is timeless.</ab>

        <ab>When it comes to web accessibility, two sets of guidelines are commonly used - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Section 508, however due to constant technology changes some rules in these guidelines become obsolete. This study seeks to add a new perspective in evaluating web accessibility - user interface/experience professionals who keep their ears on the ground for user and technology trends and focusing on users with visual impairment. It examines the Durham County Library website to find its inadequacies in catering for visually impaired users using recommendations from professional articles combined with the current guidelines (WCAG and Section 508). Results from analysis show that layout, content and navigation are the areas most lacking in accessibility while images, tables and frames are the more conforming elements. Finally, this study makes suggestions on improving the website so it is easier for the visually impaired user to access information.</ab>

        <ab>The popularity of social media has triggered the development of spammers, which produces useless information and costs normal user more time in information seeking process. In this paper, Twitter is studied as an example of spam detection in social media. Using Twitter APIs, content-based and graph-based features were extracted from datasets and analyzed with users‚Äô level of spam. Combining two kinds of features with J48, Na√ØveBayes and SVM classifiers, content-based features with J48 have the best performance in evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a study of common themes in young adult (YA) and middle grades novels published between 2006 and 2015 that feature young, undocumented immigrant protagonists who live in the United States. The themes found in the novels include the realistic yet sometimes sanitized portrayal of the violent experiences of undocumented immigrants, the protagonists‚Äô perilous journeys to the United States, their silence over their status as undocumented immigrants, their refusal to be victims which corresponds with a demonstration of agency, their desire for and assistance in getting an education, and their development or display of a hybrid identity. Overall, the novels have happy endings even in situations in which the protagonists do not obtain United States citizenship. Although the prevalence of happy endings may not be entirely true-to-life, reading the novels may be a starting point for exploring issues relevant to undocumented immigration.</ab>

In this project, a sample of 1,000 datasets were randomly chosen from the 18,000 datasets corpus. Modified TF-IDF was used in the sample data to generate key words for the 1,000 datasets and similarity analysis was followed. According to the results, we find that the key words extraction works fine in calculating similarities between different datasets.</ab>

        <ab>This study analyzes the websites of fifty-nine natural history museums accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in order to determine current practices in online collection information for natural history museums and its relationship to institutional qualities. Using a heuristic content analysis, this study looks at what collection information museums put on their own websites and external websites, search and browsing features for collection information, and whether they include written policies about loans and research visits using collection materials. Using a chi-square test, this information was analyzed in relation to demographic information, such as whether the museum is a nonprofit, affiliated with a college or university, government operated, or charges for admission. The findings of this study indicate no significant relationship between these demographic factors, but strong relationships between a museum‚Äôs likelihood to put collection information online and information about lending and research policies.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a mixed method study of change implementation resulting from flash usability testing at Duke University Libraries. Flash usability testing, also known as guerilla or on-the-fly, is a method that allows researchers to collect large amounts of data in a short amount of time with quick, unplanned think-aloud tests in a high-traffic library space. Data from usability reports was triangulated with data from interviews with members of Duke University Libraries‚Äô WebX team. WebX is a cross-departmental team that acts as ‚Äúfunctional owner‚Äù of the libraries‚Äô web presence. It commissions flash usability tests and uses the data to implement changes or spur further research. Interviews incorporated a card sort of the recommendations from every flash usability test. The paper unearths myriad attitudes toward the libraries‚Äô web presence and perceptions of the role of usability testing in the academic library. Additionally, the paper details the subsequent effectiveness of change implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Cultural heritage and art archives that exist exclusively online are becoming increasingly popular, however little has been written about their particularities. This paper presents an exploratory study of four different online cultural heritage archives: the African American Performance art Archive, Documents of 20th - century Latin American and Latino Art, Public Art Archive and Europeana. Through website analysis, each project was surveyed with respect to their mission, producer, collection development, collection materials and online presence. A synthesis of that information compares the online archives to one another and to traditional, physical archives and argues that although online archives represent a challenge to certain archival principles and practices, they also embody the monumental changes in archival science brought forth by postmodern theory and the internet. These projects raise important questions about what an archive is and what it can achieve, and should therefore be included in wider discussions about the future of the field.</ab>

The analysis was conducted on the laws and policies of twenty nations sampled for geographic diversity. The results show that while significant amounts of legislation regarding data protection have been passed around the world in the past decade; however the policies of these national archives have yet to fully adjust to a new reality of recordkeeping in the digital age.</ab>

        <ab>Business news journals provide a rich resource of business events, which enable domain experts to further understand the spatio-temporal changes occur among a set of firms and people. However, extracting structured data from journal resource that is text-based and unstructured is a non-trivial challenge. This project designs and implements a Business Information Extraction System, which combines advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools and knowledge-based extraction patterns to process and extract information of target business event from news journals automatically. The performance evaluation on the proposed system suggests that IE techniques works well on business event extraction and it is promising to apply the technique to extract more types of business events.</ab>

The observation that motivated this study in the social context was that people tended to avoid their social lives outdoors by the fear of being infected during the situation. Two time-series datasets were processed for the purpose of getting rid of seasonal patterns. The result showed that they are correlated with each other with 169 hours. It indicates that the sentiments in social media can be a good way of mirroring people‚Äôs behaviors ahead of time.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a content analysis of the cover art of 175 young adult books published within the last four years. The study was done to determine whether or not there is a gender bias in favor of girls in the young adult publishing industry. Educators across the English-speaking world are beginning to notice that teen boys are falling behind their female counterparts in reading, and some claim that this gap is due to lack of reading material for boys. This sample shows that there is a slight bias in favor of girls in young adult publishing, but the difference is not significant enough to support such claims.</ab>

        <ab>A 1 x 2 multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to assess the influence of auditory feedback on presence in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. 41 participants were assigned to a gameplay treatment condition of muted audio or sound effects only. Dependent variables were measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin, ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory, and Temple Presence Inventory. Covariates included familiarity with controls, visuospatial working memory, the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire, recent gameplay experience, computer opponent difficulty level, age, sex, and handedness. A significant multivariate effect of treatment condition was observed, but further results were inconclusive. Possible explanations and reliability analyses are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Users encounter information and communication systems (ICT) within situated, dynamic contexts with political, economic, infrastructural and socioorganizational elements. Demand for eGranary's offline library of digital content continues to grow in parts of the world that lack Internet access, particularly at schools and universities. But uptake is scattered and inconsistent, and the library's impact on localized communities and its wider effects, e.g. on pedagogy, are poorly understood. This study analyses interviews with eGranary intermediary agents active in four sub Saharan countries. These Mediators reveal some of w hat is known about the context of eGranary adoption, adaptation and the issues that stakeholders negotiate in the process. This provides background understanding for future contact with eGranary end-users Contextual characteristics identified include: reliability of technology and power supply; power-saving trends using smaller hardware and content structure; institutional and user preference for pre-tailored and/or local content; and desire for improved collection searchability.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a case study of the development, launch, and assessment of a mobile application incorporating iBeacon technology at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library. The iBeacon protocol, along with other "beacon" technologies, has enjoyed success within the retail sector as a platform for proximity marketing, and is drawing interest from libraries as a means of providing digital enhancements to visitor experiences within physical library spaces. The application launched at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library was assessed positively by library users in comparison to an earlier mobile application that duplicated features of the Library's website, although users expressed dissatisfaction with the push-messaging features present within the application. A set of best practices for incorporating beacons and other location-specific technologies in mobile applications is included for use by technologists and administrators in libraries and other cultural heritage institutions.</ab>

        <ab>One tool that public library staff use for readers' advisory is NoveList, which until 2014 was accessible to North Carolina's public librarians and patrons through a public-private partnership known as North Carolina Libraries and Virtual Education (NC LIVE). In 2014, NoveList along with other databases were dropped from NC LIVE due to financial constraints. Public library systems in North Carolina were surveyed to investigate the impact of losing access to NoveList via NC LIVE. 95% of respondents indicated that RA is either extremely or very important to the mission of their library system. The only readers' advisory tool ranked higher than NoveList was personal knowledge of the library's collection. Seven interviews with public librarians support the findings and demonstrate the continued resourcefulness of NC's public library professionals.</ab>

        <ab>This study is an in-depth evaluation of interfaces used by six interviewed educators to teach K-12 students how to code. Through examination of these discovered interfaces and interviewees' experiences with them, their utility and effectiveness for coding education is analyzed. The study reveals that much of an interface's utility relies upon the information needs of the specific educational environment. It also reveals that an interface's effectiveness, as defined by the educators interviewed, has less to do with relaying specific programming concepts and more to do with creation, exploration, student interest, and fun. The results of this study may be of help to educators interested in starting coding education programs, and need to find an interface that fits their students' needs.</ab>

        <ab>Researchers always need to find publication to support their study. Traditionally, researchers will search in an information retrieval system where researchers input a query and obtain a ranked list of retrieved results. However, traditional information retrieval systems cannot help researchers if they are in anomalous state of knowledge. Due to linguistic barriers or lack of knowledge in a field, researchers may be unable to specify a query and thus, unable to do an efficient and effective publications search. A clusterbased information retrieval system will be designed to resolve the problem by presenting a topic map. The purpose of this study is to see whether such a system could help researchers in exploring information.</ab>

        <ab>This study sought to determine whether utilizing visualization in health care would allow a wider audience of health professionals to understand geographic, temporal, and multidimensional trends in health data. A visual analytics tool was developed in Tableau that allowed users to dynamically and interactively interact with the tool in order to understand the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion. Data from the County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmap was used (Rankings Data). The tool was made available to 5 participants who all had a connection to health care. An evaluation of the tool was conducted to determine if a visual analytics approach was useful in understanding geographic, temporal, and multidimensional trends and communicating health analytics information through the form of a use case. This study concluded that visualization was in fact an effective means through which to help a variety of users to understand geographic, temporal, and multidimensional trends.</ab>

The primary research questions are: 1) Does Information and communication technologies (ICT) use of 15-year-old students in five different countries/regions that ranked a top five in Program of International Student Assessment (PISA) have positive effect on their mathematics performance controlling for other independent variables such as Mathematics self-efficacy, Mathematics self-concept, Socio-economic status and Teacher support? 2) Which independent variables have positive impact on students' mathematics performance when other independent variables are held constant? The study found that Internet use has statistically significant positive effect on student's mathematics performance while video game use has statistically negative effect on student's mathematics performance. Both higher Mathematics self-efficacy and Mathematics self-concept have statistically significant positive effect on student's mathematics performance.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the perceptions that public librarians have of their user populations with regard to people who are experiencing serious mental illness and the relationship to homelessness. Library association email listservs from multiple states across the U.S. distributed a questionnaire to their members that addressed these topics. The results found that a large number of public librarians experience concerns about violence in these populations and the impact that the presence of such users upon other users. Public librarians would be interested in learning more about serious mental illness with the goal that awareness about serious mental illness would help them in their interaction with library users who are experiencing serious mental illness. They expressed openness to trainings about serious mental illness. Such trainings would include liaisons with community agencies that work to help who are experiencing serious mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>This paper provides a new perspective of looking at emoji: Users. On 100 Twitter users represented by emojis from 200 tweets, an exploratory analysis is conducted to find patterns of emoji use for individual users. We use k-means clustering, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering on different distance measures, with special focus on outlying users with unique using patterns. Our findings could give insights of how the ways people use emoji converge and diverge, show hidden connections between emojis, and help people better understand this novel language in the digital era.</ab>

        <ab>Libraries regularly collect statistics in order to understand and communicate the value of products and services to stakeholders. These statistics, also known as metrics, can incur quantitative or qualitative data and can fall into one of five categories: input measures, process measures, output measures, outcome measures, or impact measures. Outputs, such as the number of books circulated or attendees to a webinar, are the most common, but outcomes, such as how a class helped streamline a patron's workflow, are the most desired. The monthly statistics collected in a government special library were gathered and classified according to their conformity to one of these types of performance measures. The library collected the most output metrics, followed by inputs, then outcomes. While metric diversity is beneficial, suggestions for how to improve the evaluation procedures and gain more outcomes and impacts are discussed.</ab>

        </sug>
        <ab>Health care increasingly requires complicated self-care regimens that demand patients and family caregivers learn about unfamiliar topics and practices to support their recovery. Due to the prevalence of low health literacy, patient education materials must comply with health literacy standards so that all patients understand how to take care of themselves. This content analysis examines the quality and consistency of patient education materials used at a large academic medical center to inform self-care of bums, tracheostomy, and peripherally-inserted central catheters. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT) was used to evaluate thirteen patient education materials from inpatient, outpatient, and home health settings. PEMAT scores were associated with the presence of visual aids and document source. Consistency of materials was greatest among documents describing self-care for bums. Study methods employed may be used as a foundation for assessment of additional patient education materials.</ab>

        <ab>International students are an expanding population at universities in the United States. It is important that academic librarians understand the information needs and unique challenges of this patron group and address their needs accordingly. This study explores international students' use of Davis Library at UNC-CH from the perspective of both academic librarians and international students. The study employed semi-structured interviews with three academic librarians at Davis Library and ten international students who have used Davis Library. The responses demonstrated areas in which the library is serving international students effectively and ineffectively, and it illustrated some of the challenges these patrons face in locating resources within the library.</ab>

        <ab>Many studies have shown the stereotypical characteristics of female protagonists in the original fairy tales. Many characters are passive, and rarely show any masculine characteristics. For today's young adults, retellings of fairy tales are popular topics for teens to read and they want to be able to relate to the characters and stories found within. Using a modified version of the Bern Sex Role instrument, this quantitative content analysis compares the female protagonists in five selected fairy tales to their counterparts in five young adult fairy tale retellings from recent authors. Flave the female protagonists stayed more feminine or do they portray more masculine qualities? Are roles still gender biased, or have they become neutral? This study explored the changes that retellings of fairy tales have taken towards addressing gender stereotypes.</ab>

        <ab>So much of project planning is circumstantial. Even after the approval of a formal project proposal or plan, an unsuspecting shift in environmental factors can often alter or redirect a project's original objectives, goals, and purpose. In the face of such change it is not uncommon for members of a project team to find themselves, in a sense, "on the road again," re-evaluating and perhaps even re-envisioning the course and direction of a project. Project planning practiced in this way--as a continuous process as opposed to a single, linear stage completed prior to a project's launch--provided the small, one-person transportation research library at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC) with a manageable way to plan and keep project documentation during a three-year period, from 2013 to 2016, that saw tremendous change to the library and its larger role at HSRC. This report documents the process of composing a project plan for transferring HSRC Library's archival collection of original research manuscripts, publications, and ephemera to UNC-CH University Archives and illustrates one way a project planner might create and keep project plan documentation within small and single-librarian environments.</ab>

        <ab>This master's project was developed for the Development Finance Initiative (DFI), a program of the School of Government (SOG) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The goal of this master's project was to build a website to assist DFI track key project metrics, compare projects through those metrics, and develop an internal knowledge base that could lead to evidence-based practices for the redevelopment of a distressed community. Moreover, this master's project is part of the greater push for standardization in DFI's workflow and describes how an organization under twenty employees can develop a system for collecting, storing, and displaying key project metrics to better document the impact of the organization's work.</ab>

        <ab>Over the past sixty-eight years, oral history interviews have emerged as valuable primary sources of research by capturing nuanced perspectives of the past. Proponents argue that the enduring value of these resources stems from their ability to fill the gap in archives by giving voice to those who have been historically marginalized in society. For much of the twentieth century these voices remained silent, as archivists struggled to provide access to these unique acquisitions. The digital revolution has ignited new hopes that technology can resolve the problems of access to oral history collections. This paper aims to shed light on how oral histories have been presented in the digital interfaces of several collections from Africa, Australia, Europe, and North America. By examining the content that is available to users worldwide, a clearer image of the priorities and standards used in this new era of oral histories will be revealed.</ab>

        <ab>Ethical hackers emulate the processes of cyber-criminals in controlled settings in order to test the security posture of their clients. One common part of this process is testing the susceptibility to social engineering. This study explores the information seeking habits of Ethical Hackers during the reconnaissance phase of a social engineering attack in order to better understanding the strategies involved in cyber-crime. Eight ethical hackers with social engineering experience were interviewed using contextual inquiry. Participants were asked to walk through their process for gathering information in two-three social engineering scenarios as well as asked to describe the scenario they most often encounter. The study revealed a semi-structured, cyclic approach to information gathering that used many of the same tools as everyday life social search. The results of this study should help businesses and individuals better understand the risk of posting information in public forums.</ab>

        <ab>Data sets collected in the real world usually contain large amounts of features, many of which are interdependent with each other. The number of dimensions that can be shown concurrently with modern visualization techniques often does not match the number of features contained in the dataset, and this discrepancy can lead to selection bias undetected. This paper presents an advanced visualization system designed to enable sample bias detection introduced during the high-dimensional data selection and visualization, and to support the bias reduction using a sample-reweighting algorithm. A detailed description of the system's web-based interactive user interface is provided. In addition, the results from an 11-participant user study on the system are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in practice.</ab>

        <ab>This research examined how people perceive current site connection indicator icons and corresponding informational message statements found in six web browsers. The paper begins by providing some background of the research area as well as an overview of the site connection indicator icon and informational message statement. An online survey was also conducted, which asked participants to best match statements from the informational messages with site connection indicator icons. The main finding of this research was that based on the wording of the informational message statements, participants often chose corresponding site connection indicator icons in a manner similar to how web browser developers paired the site connection indicator icons and informational message statements. This provides evidence that web browser users perceive the informational message statements as generally matching the site connection indicator icons that represent them.</ab>

The newly developed mobile app is then evaluated by usability inspection and usability test on a few test subjects. The test showed that new functions come with the mobile app is efficient in providing new features that are useful when booking and checking the room for more information. The author concluded that the new system could be helpful for users to manage room booking by themselves and offered further development suggestions to the system.</ab>

This exploratory study investigates the frequency of photographs and historic photographs embedded as illustrations in Wikipedia articles. A random sample of 500 articles was examined, in which roughly half of all articles lacked any illustrations; 128 articles, or 26% of the sample included photographs; of those, only 26 articles, or 5% of the sample, included historic photographs. Sources are examined to determine where these photographs originated, and suggestions are made for future research into related factors and potential automation using software to collect data.</ab>

        <ab>Using semi-structured interviews, this study describes how varieties of data librarians in North Carolina stay up-to-date in their fields. As data based research and decision-making has become ubiquitous within academic communities, librarians have been required to gain new technical and interpersonal skills to help them in navigating data related patrons and tasks. The study documents the specific strategies and techniques that participants use to provide useful service to patrons and continue learning over changing learning environments. These strategies and the experiences that the participants use for professional development could be applicable to library schools that are open to adjusting curriculums in order to support greater data literacy and datarelated skills among their new graduates.

        <ab>Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a growing population that public libraries serve. This study sets out to discover what children with ASD use their public library for and what they would like the library to change or improve in order to best serve them. Eight children with ASD and their families were interviewed for this purpose. Results showed areas where public libraries are serving children with ASD effectively and ineffectively and pointed to a greater need for universal design.</ab>

        <ab>Few studies have focused on the information-seeking behaviors of archival users interested in particular cultural communities. But as community and social history are growing areas of research, it is important that archivists investigate how users identify and access relevant materials within their holdings. Of particular consideration are researchers interested in Native American communities. Collections related to Native Americans are not only dispersed across multiple indigenous and non-indigenous archives, but frequently described in ways that reflect inaccurate and outdated colonial ideologies. In this exploratory study, six archival users interested in Native American collections were interviewed about their information-seeking behaviors and research challenges. Findings from these interviews suggest several strategies for making Nativerelated collections more discoverable and accessible in culturally appropriate ways. Each of these strategies depends on creating and sustaining cooperative, collaborative, and mutually beneficial partnerships with Native communities.</ab>

        <ab>This study used diaries and interviews to examine everyday information seeking behaviors among a group of frequent users of intelligent personal assistants. All participants completed diaries and met for a brief interview following the completion of their diaries. Diary responses captured real life examples of intelligent personal assistant usage, while interviews focused on general perceptions of intelligent personal assistants. Participants frequently used their intelligent personal assistants to find factual information but often expressed reluctance to ask assistants questions that would be difficult tor the assistants to answer well. Many assistant uses were for repetitive and frequent types of information needs. Participants expressed mixed opinions about the appropriateness of intelligent personal assistant use in social situations. Some, though not all, of the findings of this study confirm the findings of other research in the growing body of research on intelligent personal assistants.</ab>

        <ab>Broaching issues related to archives' ethical obligations to participants, transcripts as derivative documents, and web publication of archival materials, this case study explores the development of web access policies in oral history archives by examining the complications that emerged during the Archives of American Arts' (AAA) transcript review and web publication of a set of oral history interviews conducted in 2007-2008 with the Guerrilla Girls. Using program documentation and interview and questionnaire data from current and former Archives staff members as well as from a user of the Guerrilla Girls material, this study compares the AAA's standard processes for oral history collection to the process of collecting the Guerrilla Girls interviews. Study participants discussed lessons learned from decisions made regarding web access to those interviews. Findings from this study bear a potentially transferable relationship to policy review for oral history collections, archives' donor/patron relations, and web access to oral histories.</ab>

        <ab>This is an investigation of perpetual access rights and archival provisions for licensed electronic resources at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Perpetual access refers to post-cancellation access to e-resources. Archival provisions specify the format of perpetual access to these resources. E-resources, including e-joumals and databases, make up the majority of many libraries' collections budgets. Tightening budgets may force librarians to make the difficult decision to cancel large e-joumal packages or other subscribed resources. Negotiating strong perpetual access clauses into license agreements ensures continued access to these resources. In addition, provider participation in thirdparty archiving services allows for long-term preservation and access. This investigation examines the state of perpetual access and archival provisions for licensed e-resources at UNC-Chapel Hill.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years, the federal government has mandated that data produced using federal funds be made available to the public. This, and the recent surge in the amount of data produced and the size of datasets, have made the pressure to share data ever the more urgent. Data can be shared using open access repositories, which can be institutional or domain-specific. In the social sciences in particular, data sharing is unique because of the various sources and types of data produced. This paper examined the usage patterns of the datasets in one social science repository based on production date. It found that the average number of download statistics for each year was remarkably consistent, but the data were extremely skewed. Further analyses could look at usage patterns based on topic/keyword, non-use of datasets, or time of usage of particular datasets.</ab>

        <ab>Digital Humanities scholars have not traditionally been focused on the overall usability of their online projects or how users perceive these resources. As a result. Digital Humanities is in danger of leaving out users voices entirely. This presents an opportunity for libraries, as partners, to add value to digital scholarship by assessing the extent to which Digital Humanities resources are meeting the needs of its users. The following study is a qualitative user assessment of Project Vox, a Digital Humanities initiative that provides pedagogical and research materials on underrepresented philosophers from the early modern period. Through interviewing six philosophy professors, this user assessment takes into account humanists' existing workflows, investigates their usage and the usability of the site, and finally examines how they perceive some of Project Vox's practices and the broader Digital Humanities landscape.</ab>

The interviews were conducted to identify records management challenges and factors influencing public records management at these institutions. The interviews revealed that timely records disposition and electronic records management were the two most common records management challenges. Additional factors influencing records management were employees' level of records management knowledge, the role and responsibilities of the Chief Records Officer and the level of legal and institutional support the records management programs received. Overall, Chief Records Officers believed they had strong records management programs and adhered to the instructions of the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.</ab>

        <ab>The decline in the number of school librarians throughout the United States could have far reaching consequences for students and teachers. In an increasingly digital environment, many believe the school librarian to be an antiquated concept. The development of exceptional library programs through the use of evidence-based practices cements the role of librarian as valuable instructional and resource partner. The role of the librarian in shaping the attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions of stakeholders directly affects the perception of value. The purpose of this research was to investigate the role of the school librarian in implementing evidence-based practice through semi structured interviews. Nowhere is this more important than in school libraries where building a strong library program will begin with collecting and disseminating empirical evidence. Interviews revealed that school librarians are participating in collecting and sharing data, but it does not have the same qualities of rigorously methodical science. Library science is, at its core, a social sciences and librarians have managed to create a model for collecting data that applies to the environment where they are teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. The ambivalence regarding whether the collection of data by school librarians should be labeled 'evidence based practice' remains uncertain.</ab>

        <ab>Clutter is an aspect of web aesthetics that has come to the fore in recent years as the research community works toward a fuller understanding of what clutter is and how it affects users' perceptions and performance with interfaces. In this paper, I examine the possible effects of cultural background on users' first impressions of display clutter in website designs. The study was conducted using a series of five-second impression tests that asked participants from two distinct cultural groups to view a set of screenshots encompassing multiple levels of clutter, as measured by a JPEG file size measure. Results showed some effects from cultural background on perceptions of clutter, raised some issues with the cross-cultural applicability of the objective JPEG measure's ability to predict subjective judgments, and provide some evidence that organization is a key distinguishing factor between visual complexity and clutter.</ab>

        <ab>Legal scholarship is unique amongst nearly all disciplines because it is edited and published through student-run law reviews and journals rather than through the traditional peer-review and editing processes. The student-edited law review system has been in place for over a century and serves two purposes: (1) to act as a vehicle for legal scholarship and (2) to serve as a learning opportunity for American law students. Law reviews are cited by practicing attorneys, judges, and legislators, and these publications have helped to shape the current state of American law. However, law students who serve as staff members on these journals often receive little training and support from legal institutions and faculty. This research paper explores the types of services that academic law libraries are providing for staff members of student-edited law reviews and journals and seeks to identify emerging best practices and areas for further expansion of services.</ab>

        <ab>Since academic libraries began to open their doors to students in the late 19th to early 20th century, librarians have engaged in nearly continuous discussion of the college student's need for leisure reading materials, the broad benefits of reading such material, and the declining rate of American literacy. Given that budget is one of the most frequently cited obstacles to providing browsing collections or leisure reading materials in academic libraries today, understanding strategies used by librarians in tight times in the past may be informative for present-day academic librarians. This thesis addresses whether/to what extent the incorporation of the campus trade book store, the Bull's Head, into the university library at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1935, at the height of the Great Depression, was one such strategy.</ab>

The project assessed the diversity and inclusion education available to SILS master's students. The sample consists of course titles, descriptions, and syllabi from a two-year period (August 2015 through May 2017). The method used was content analysis, using a coding scheme based on existing literature as well as language and concepts found in the sample. It is hoped that the results provide a current depiction of the role of diversity and inclusion in the master's degree at SILS.</ab>

        <ab>This study aims to understand how individuals who participate in basic computer classes navigate life within the digital divide. Much of the literature available about the digital divide and literacy takes a reductionist focus on the abilities of those learning how to use computers. This study incorporates the literature and frameworks from Everyday Life Information Practices and library as place to inform the direction of the study. The goal of the study was to examine the information practices of older adults in computer classes and gain insight on how they have developed strategies to live in a technology centric world. Overall, the study found that these individuals are creative and resilient when it comes to navigating the digital divide. The implications of this study can be applied to iuture understandings of the library as a learning place, a positive approach to LIS research, and accessible and adaptable system design.</ab>

For an online shopping website, such as Amazon.com, it is very important to recommend high-quality product reviews to the website users because customers make decisions based on what they read from the reviews. However, there are simply way too many reviews out there, and it would be a dreadful task for anyone to read them all. In this paper, we try to build a logistic regression model that can than predict helpfulness of reviews.</ab>

        <ab>Online reviews have been widely used for sentiment analysis tasks, for example, sentiment polarity prediction. In this paper, I address the rating prediction problem, using Yelp reviews. A star rating, in most cases, agrees with its review sentiment, which makes sentiment-words a reasonable solution for this task. Topics in reviews, on the other hand, are also likely to influence rating prediction. For example, for a restaurant, a customer may think it has a 5-stars service but the food is just 3-stars. So overall, that customer might give that restaurant a 4-stars rating. Using this idea, in this paper, I investigate whether topics, in addition to sentiment, are helpful in rating prediction task. I incorporated topic model with sentiment model and observed performance improvement.</ab>

        <ab>Supporting Library Departments through Data Visualization sought to demonstrate the power of data visualization in supporting library departments' potential to leverage internal data and improve communication and decision-making processes. In collaboration with the User Experience and Research and Instruction department at Davis Library -UNC Chapel Hill and the Southern Historical Collection Wilson Library - UNC Chapel Hill, I developed a series of visualizations after conducting a needs assessment of department. For Davis Library, I developed a series of visualizations analyzing user engagement with UNC Library LibGuides in effort to support their annual content review and for Wilson Library, I developed a series of visualizations to support digitization planning efforts.</ab>

        <ab>This paper analyzes the representation of women in wartime era comics during World War Two (1941-1945) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (2001-2010). The questions addressed are: In what ways are women represented in WWII era comic books? What ways are they represented in Post 9/11 comic books? How are the representations similar or different? In what ways did the outside war environment influence the depiction of women in these comic books? In what ways did the comic books influence the women in the war outside the comic pages? This research will closely examine two vital periods in the publications of comic books. The World War II era includes the genesis and development to the first war-themed comics. In addition many classic comic characters were introduced during this time period. In the post-9/11 and Operation Iraqi Freedom time period war-themed comics reemerged as the dominant format of comics.</ab>

        <ab>Collection development is at the core of library services. With growing awareness of diverse communities and the lack of diverse representation in literature and the publishing industry, it is essential that librarians create collection development policies that accurately and effectively advocate for diversity and representation within a library collection. This is especially imperative for youth librarians, who are serving patrons going through a process of identity development and have the potential to be deeply harmed by inaccurate portrayal of their communities. This study examined how librarians can use collection development policies and ongoing education to curate diverse collections. The study consisted of four semi-structured interviews with librarians and professionals in fields of children's literature, some of whom are also members of marginalized populations, exploring topics of diverse literature, specific factors librarians should be aware of, and the language participants would like to see explicitly addressed in collection development policies.</ab>

        <ab>Superheroes are a huge commercial tent pole in today's pop cultural landscape. Their representations are part of the fabric of our culture, and the superhero concept comes with a history of hyper-masculinity and extreme gender expression. This paper explores three superheroes' recent comic iterations - Hawkeye, Black Lightning, and King Tiger - to evaluate the cultural accuracy of the hero's performance of masculine identity. The comics were coded by the researcher, and each was intercoded by a member of the race of the hero in question. While culturally accurate masculine elements were present in all character's performances, culture is not central to their masculinities and the hegemonic ideal is still a heavy influence on all.</ab>

        <ab>This study was conducted in order to uncover ways in which public libraries help their communities before, during, and after hurricane events. A systematized review of the literature found in six Library and Information Science and Health Sciences databases revealed public libraries offer services that contribute to the user's fulfillment of multiple needs. Results from twenty full-text articles were categorized and four themes were identified: physical needs, emotional or mental needs, logistical needs, and information needs. By identifying how these public libraries have provided outreach in their communities during hurricane events, other libraries will have the opportunity to learn from their experiences.</ab>

        <ab>There has been significant work in extracting medical related information from clinical notes and EHR records. With the increasing use of social media tools for healthcare purposes, there is an abundance of patient generated data with valuable information. Recent studies have focused on extraction of useful information from patient generated content. Healthcare professionals also use social media platforms for various purposes. Existing clinical NLP tools are specialized in processing biomedical literature and clinical texts. For efficient processing of social media text, it's important to analyze it's linguistic characteristics. In this paper the difference between language used by physicians in weblogs and the language used by patients in health discussion forums is analyzed by determining the frequency of usage of MetaMap concepts, affect words and named entities by both the groups. The results show that patient language differs from physician language in these aspects. So the existing clinical NLP tools require additional functionalities for automatic processing of text.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the chat reference interview as performed by the libraries at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Chat transcripts containing were purposively selected from two periods, October 1-21, 2015 and March 1 - 21, 2016. These two periods were selected in order to give the study a view of chat reference as conducted by staff at different points in training and with different levels of experience. These transcripts were analyzed according to a series of questions, in order to determine whether or not the reference interactions resulted in the satisfaction of a patron's information need. Through this analysis, it was determined that the reference interview as performed at UNC is effective, but incomplete implementations of the interview create significant barriers to the successful completion of reference interactions.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes an exploratory study that was conducted to determine how academic libraries use Google Analytics, and how they balance the implementation of Google Analytics with their patrons' privacy. UNC System Library websites were surveyed to determine whether or not they utilized Google Analytics. The privacy policies of the 13 websites that ran Google Analytics were examined to determine whether their privacy policies contained language disclosing the presence of Google Analytics on the library website. In addition, interviews were conducted with employees from five of the libraries to determine how those libraries employ Google Analytics on their websites and how they balance the employment of Google Analytics with the privacy of their patrons. Four out of the five libraries reported actively using Google Analytics, but only one of those five library websites contained a privacy policy with explicit language pertaining to the website's use of Google Analytics.</ab>

A web survey was conducted in an attempt to discover: why young adults are creating these series; how they are choosing which texts to adapt; why the series seem to be focused on youth of marginalized identities; and why they are being hosted on interactive, social media platforms. The paper explores facets of identity development, representation, and restorying in the context of these series and their creators.</ab>

        <ab>There is a concerning development occurring in today's libraries stemming from a complex intellectual history and fed by contemporary identity culture and politics. This is the increasing hold that a class of ideas is having on the underpinnings of librarianship: namely, those ideas commonly styled 'postmodern.' The effect that postmodernist thinking has had on libraries is threefold: It gives the profession a theoretical stance about knowledge that is unfit for accomplishing the emancipatory aims of the library; undermines the pursuance of libraries as a public good; indulges an unreasonable skepticism about authority in general.</ab>

        <ab>In the spring of 1992, the city of Sarajevo was surrounded by nationalist Serb troops and bombarded with shells, bullets, and terror for four long years. Isolated from the world, Sarajevans found a refuge and a freedom that took them beyond their circumstances: they read, they wrote, and they survived. This paper examines how these activities impacted the mental, physical, and spiritual survival of Sarajevans during the war. Diaries, memoirs, personal histories, letter collections, and oral histories are analyzed for what they may reveal about the value of reading and writing during this time of crisis. What we learn from these accounts is that even during the most trying times, activities such as reading and writing give us a space for control and self-preservation. This paper strives to learn about the power of literacy and writing from those who faced adversity in wartom Sarajevo.</ab>

        <ab>This study is a content analysis presenting and summarizing the existing online documentation concerning the topic of genrefication. Genrefication is the organization of public and or school libraries' collections by subject heading rather than according to the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC). This is a heated controversial trend dating back to the 1890s. Elowever, little has been added to the professional conversation since 2013. This paper seeks to lay a foundation for an informed discussion on the topic by culminating the existing information up to 2017 in a single location for introduction and further research and or discussion. It highlights the contributing factors enabling genrefication's continued existence and success despite the lack of additional professional publications on the topic.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the presentation and perception of the libraries by tour guides at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during Admissions campus tours for prospective students and families. Perspectives from tour guides, librarians, and admissions staff are considered through an analysis of tour observations and interviews with library and admissions staff. Tour guides' statements about the libraries varied, sometimes containing misperceptions and inaccurate claims, but for the most part indicating that they viewed the libraries as positive and valuable places. This paper discusses the value of collaboration between academic libraries and admissions departments to ensure that guide training incorporates useful and relevant information about the library that will aid prospective students in (1) understanding the library's role on a university campus, (2) feeling welcome and comfortable in the library space, and (3) envisioning themselves using the library and taking advantage of library spaces, collections, services, and staff.</ab>

        <ab>Cameras are included as a standard piece of equipment on many electronic devices, which make it increasingly easier for people to document their lives with photographs as moments occur. As a result, personal photographic collections continue to grow in size, and assume a wealth of complications related to an individual's ability to manage the size ot their collection and considerations for preservation. The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term preservation techniques of the personal digital photographic collections of the Millennial Generation, and to inform archivists and others involved with memory institutions about the ways this generation thinks and acts upon the preservation ot these collections. The population for this study was chosen using a nonprobability, convenience sample of students and employees between the ages of 18 and 37 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The data was collected using an anonymous multiple-choice survey.</ab>

        <ab>This research study aimed at studying the SILS website and understanding if the current design catered well to the needs of three user groups; faculty, staff members, and current students. An online survey questionnaire was created and sent to the listserv of the three user groups. Out of the 58 responses that were received, 17 were MSIS students, 18 MSLS, 2 BSIS, 5 Faculty, 4 were staff, and the rest chose to remain unidentified. Participants were asked about their usage, level of satisfaction, level of difficulty, and kinds of issues they faced, their opinions and feedback regarding various sections of the SILS website along with the embedded pages within. The responses suggest that although participants were fairly satisfied with the website, there were areas that could be improved in the site's navigation, deeply embedded links, and inconsistent information.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study describes the results of a survey of 39 self-published writers who were contacted through several North-Carolina-based writers' groups. The survey was intended to determine background about the platforms and formats they used as well as the importance these writers placed on the preservation of their work, asking whether they had lost files or had tried to get their work into libraries. Follow-up interviews with four writers who took the survey feature their reflections on being an "indie author," including their methods for finding an audience, how they learn information about self-publishing, and the challenges and benefits they have experienced from the process. The study begins with a literature review that includes interviews with two librarians and a small publisher in North Carolina. The study concludes with a number of implications for further research, as well as a discussion of the major finding that publicity equals preservation.</ab>

        <ab>Archives, libraries, and museums focused on performing arts have collected musical instruments alongside traditional archival materials in order to connect patrons with the tools musicians and composers utilize to shape cultural legacies. This mixed-methods study illuminates how cultural heritage institutions apply basic archival functions (appraisal, arrangement, description, access, and preservation) to musical instruments. Representatives from four such institutions were interviewed: Three archives (The Institute of Jazz Studies, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Library &amp; Archives, and the Louis Armstrong Archives) and one museum (The Metropolitan Museum of Art). Simultaneously, a survey was distributed to archivists, with respondents detailing their experiences and philosophies related to archiving musical instruments. Issues discussed by those interviewed and surveyed included the importance of a well-defined collecting policy, an access policy that makes holdings available to users while ensuring that the artifacts accessed are subjected to minimal potential damage, and approaches to instrument preservation.</ab>

        <ab>Research consultations are meetings between a patron and a librarian during which the librarian attempts to assist the patron with their information or research need. Many academic libraries have implemented research consultation services as part of the suite of reference services that their libraries offer. Outside of the reference interview model created for the traditional reference desk setting, no model has been put forth to provide guidance to librarians attempting to learn how to perform a research consultation, which can differ significantly from traditional reference desk interactions because of their intensive and personal nature. The ultimate goal of this study is to investigate how the librarians who provide research consultations learned their craft both in terms of their ability to conduct the more technical aspects of a research consultation and their ability to manage the affective elements of the research consultation.</ab>

        <ab>Academic Librarians have been creating research guides since the 1950s. These resources were design to help patrons become familiar with the basics of a subject or discipline. Research guides evolved into course pages, which provide resources related to a single course. This study considers students' perceptions, and how that effects their intent to use the course page in the future. The study seeks to answer the question, does students' perception of usefulness, interactivity, ease-of-use, attitude, and satisfaction effect their intention to use course pages? The method used for this study is adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model which looks for correlations between perceived usefulness, interactivity, ease-of-use, attitude, satisfaction, and intention to use. 47 undergraduate students from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, responded to an online survey. These findings will help determine if student perceptions match the findings from previous studies regarding the usability and implementation of course pages.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes the design and development of a website to introduce the problem of gender diversity in tech through narrative data visualizations. It combines three publicly available datasets describing the demographics of technologists in high school, university, and industry, presenting them together to provide a full picture of how badly underrepresented women are in tech fields. Viewers can interact with detailed visualizations of each dataset to explore their own questions, without the analytical expertise necessary to analyze the raw data. The data visualizations are supplemented with narrative explanations of the relevant academic literature, so that even viewers without background knowledge can interpret the data in the correct context.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines how well North Carolina public libraries use Facebook and Twitter to portray themselves as community information providers in the face of social and environmental disasters. As technology connects people more and more on a daily basis, public libraries are continuing to connect themselves to patrons as well by using social media to extend, and even create, new services that they would not have been able to twenty years ago, or at least not as well as new technologies and software are allowing them to now. However, in the face of community strife, emergencies, disasters of a social, environmental, political, or economic nature, can public libraries use the power through alternative avenues to reach out to their communities and provide as unbiased resources as possible?</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the nature and scope of collaborations between institutional archival repositories and community groups. Seven community-based archival research initiatives were chosen and examined, including: Historically Black Towns and Settlements Alliance, Documenting Ferguson, D.C Africaana Archives Project, Black Metropolis Research Consortium, Institutional Archives on Women and Architecture, Eighth Air Force Archive, and the Saints at War Project. Interviews with the professionals at these initiatives helped the researcher to identify perceptions regarding how the partnerships form, the activities performed by each of the participants, how materials were collected and maintained, and the long-term sustainability of these ettorts. This research has numerous implications for the archival profession, including both benefits and barriers to collaboration. Archivists at other institutions can look to this research when attempting to democratize collecting practices and develop lasting partnerships with surrounding communities.</ab>

        <ab>This study aims to develop a deeper understanding of the individuals who are special librarians. In order to create this defining view into special librarianship, a secondary analysis of the Workforce Issues in Library and Information Science (WILIS) was completed. Comparisons were made between special librarians and librarians who work in traditional library settings to determine significant patterns and differences. Through statistical testing, the areas of inspiration, education, career history, and job satisfaction were explored. Despite their similarities, the two librarian types differed with their motivations and valued job characteristics. Special librarians would often value job qualities uniquely available in special libraries, like flexible career options and opportunities for advancement while they were less inspired by the service-oriented aspects of traditional librarianship, like helping others and making a difference in society. Results from this study create a clearer definition of who special librarians are and what makes them so special.</ab>

        <ab>As libraries, archives, and museums (" LAMs" ) adopt linked data for purposes of enhancing their bibliographic and authority metadata, the technologies around digital repositories also are similarly changing course to model digital objects using linked data standards such as RDF. This study explores the digital repository community's engagement and perceptions of linked data modeling. The study is split into two phases consisting of a web survey and semistructured interviews. Qualitative analysis of the data summarizes key characteristics of the community of practice, and open problems in transitioning to linked data in the redesign of the Fedora storage and preservation architecture commonly used in digital repositories. Other areas of discussion include the perceived concerns in cross-walking MODS to RDF, as well as the community's recommended implementation of the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM).</ab>

        <ab>This project develops a web database management system for Gfeller Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This system allows users to upload and download structured data in terms of specific requirements. The Gfeller Center works on research that studies the health condition of athletes. Researchers have collected a large amount of data from previous studies and they keep collecting data as the research goes on. The researchers need tools to help manage and organize the data and need advanced functionality to support their research. Therefore, this project helps to develop a web database system to manage data according to the requirements of the researchers in Gfeller Center. The system development includes requirements analysis, functionality analysis, and interface design. Finally, this project proposes a plan for usability testing to evaluate the system.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the use of trusted digital repository tools and standards for self-audit in digital repositories. While there has been increasing attention given to external audit and certification of trusted digital repositories, there has not yet been a cross-institutional study of repository self-audits. Describing a series of semi-structured interviews with six information professionals employed at six university digital repositories, this study examines these repositories' experiences with self-audit. The study explores the tools that are being used for selfaudit, how self-audits are conducted, and the value of self-audit to repositories and their stakeholders. Findings from this study provide some insight into the current state of selfaudit in digital repositories, and the paper also suggests areas for improvement and future research in this field.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity and inclusion are hot topics in the world of education and libraries are in a position to be at the forefront of this movement given their close relationship with the public. Having diverse books in a library collection is one part of ensuring a more diverse and inclusive space. Teens and young adults are readers who greatly benefit from having diverse materials available to them. To examine whether or not diverse YA books are available and searchable via subject headings two public libraries in North Carolina were examined. The subject headings assigned to 60 chosen YA books proved to be a sufficient and easy way to search for and find these materials. Despite being able to find these diverse books via the catalog there are still ways to improve the way libraries are organizing their materials on the shelves to ensure diverse books can be found.</ab>

The interviews were conducted to determine the different assessment criteria used by teens and teen librarians when assessing teen programs in public libraries. Subjects at six different teen programs at four public libraries were used to explore the similarities and differences in assessment of teen programs. In these North Carolina public libraries, teens and teen librarians use both similar and dissimilar criteria to measure program success.</ab>
